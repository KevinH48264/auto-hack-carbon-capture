New research proposal:

1) Purpose:
The purpose of this research proposal is to develop a more efficient carbon capture system by leveraging the findings from a recent research paper on oxygen-stable electrochemical CO2 capture and concentration with quinones using alcohol additives. The goal is to address the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in the initial approach and improve the overall efficiency of the carbon capture process.

2) Background and current state:
The initial approach is a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system that utilizes an electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone-carbon nanotube composite negative electrode for CO2 capture. However, the system is sensitive to oxygen, which reduces its efficiency. The research paper's findings demonstrate that the addition of alcohol additives can anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, resulting in an oxygen-stable electrochemical CO2 capture system with improved efficiency.

3) Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that by incorporating the research paper's findings on using alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, we can develop an oxygen-stable electrochemical CO2 capture system that is more efficient than the initial approach in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured.

4) Methodology:
The proposed methodology involves synthesizing a quinone redox carrier and optimizing its properties through the addition of alcohol additives. The electrochemical behavior of the redox carrier will be characterized using techniques such as cyclic voltammetry and electronic absorption spectroscopy. The CO2 capture performance of the system will be evaluated using a parallel passage contactor bed setup, similar to the initial approach. The system will be tested under various conditions, including different CO2 concentrations and oxygen levels, to assess its stability and efficiency.

5) Expected outcomes:
We expect that by incorporating the research paper's findings, the proposed system will exhibit improved faradaic efficiency, higher capture capacity, and enhanced durability compared to the initial approach. The system is expected to achieve a higher GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured, making it more efficient for carbon capture applications.

6) Biggest risks and ways to mitigate those risks:
The biggest risk is the potential for the alcohol additives to negatively affect the overall performance of the system or introduce unwanted side reactions. To mitigate this risk, a thorough characterization of the redox carrier and alcohol additives will be conducted to understand their interactions and optimize their concentrations. Additionally, careful control of the experimental conditions, such as oxygen levels and CO2 concentrations, will be implemented to minimize any potential adverse effects. Regular monitoring and analysis of the system's performance will also be carried out to identify and address any issues that may arise.
