The tangential research paper's main findings are significant because they provide insights into the reduction of quinones, which is a key component of the initial approach for carbon capture. The paper explores the effects of hydrogen-bonding and protonation on the potentials and mechanisms of quinone reduction. It identifies three different types of electrochemical behavior based on the interaction between quinones and hydroxylic additives.

These findings can be useful in addressing the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in the carbon capture system. By understanding the role of hydrogen-bonding and protonation, we can potentially modify the quinone polymer to make it less reactive with oxygen. This could improve the overall efficiency of the system by reducing the oxidation of the reduced quinones.

Research Proposal:

1) Purpose:
The purpose of this research is to develop a more efficient carbon capture system by leveraging the findings from the tangential research paper. Specifically, we aim to address the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen by modifying the quinone polymer to reduce its reactivity with oxygen.

2) Background and Current State:
The initial approach for carbon capture involves a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system that utilizes the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones. However, the system is sensitive to oxygen, which can cause oxidation of the reduced quinones and reduce the overall efficiency. The tangential research paper's findings on the effects of hydrogen-bonding and protonation in quinone reduction provide valuable insights for addressing this key problem.

3) Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that by modifying the quinone polymer to enhance hydrogen-bonding and reduce protonation, we can reduce the reactivity of the quinones with oxygen. This will improve the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system by minimizing the oxidation of the reduced quinones.

To explain this hypothesis to unfamiliar audiences, we need to introduce the concept of hydrogen-bonding and protonation. Hydrogen-bonding refers to the attractive interaction between a hydrogen atom bonded to an electronegative atom (such as oxygen) and another electronegative atom. Protonation refers to the addition of a proton (H+) to a molecule. In the context of quinone reduction, hydrogen-bonding and protonation can affect the potentials and mechanisms of the reduction process.

4) Methodology:
To test our hypothesis, we will first synthesize different quinone polymers with varying degrees of hydrogen-bonding and protonation capabilities. This can be achieved by modifying the chemical structure of the quinone molecules and introducing functional groups that promote or inhibit hydrogen-bonding and protonation.

Next, we will evaluate the reactivity of these modified quinone polymers with oxygen. This can be done by exposing the quinone polymers to oxygen in controlled environments and monitoring the oxidation reactions using spectroscopic techniques.

We will also assess the carbon capture performance of the modified quinone polymers. This will involve conducting experiments similar to the initial approach, where the quinone polymers are used in an electrochemical cell to capture and release CO2. We will measure the faradaic efficiency, energy consumption, and durability of the modified quinone polymers.

5) Expected Outcomes:
We expect that the modified quinone polymers with enhanced hydrogen-bonding and reduced protonation will exhibit reduced reactivity with oxygen. This will result in improved efficiency of the carbon capture system, as the oxidation of the reduced quinones will be minimized.

Furthermore, we anticipate that the modified quinone polymers will maintain high faradaic efficiency, comparable or better than the initial approach. The energy consumption per ton of CO2 captured is expected to be lower, indicating a more efficient carbon capture system.

6) Biggest Risks and Mitigation:
The biggest risk in this research is the possibility that modifying the quinone polymer may negatively impact its carbon capture performance. The changes in the chemical structure could alter the electrochemical properties of the quinones, leading to reduced efficiency or stability.

To mitigate this risk, we will conduct thorough characterization and testing of the modified quinone polymers before implementing them in the carbon capture system. We will assess their electrochemical properties, stability, and carbon capture performance in controlled laboratory conditions. Additionally, we will compare the performance of the modified quinone polymers with the initial approach to ensure that any modifications result in improvements rather than setbacks.

By carefully addressing these risks and conducting comprehensive experiments, we aim to develop a more efficient carbon capture system that surpasses the state-of-the-art in terms of energy consumption per ton of CO2 captured.
