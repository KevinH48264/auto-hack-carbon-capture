Among these negative emissions technologies,\ndirect air capture (DAC), in which CO 2is captured directly from the atmosphere, could play an\nimportant role. The captured CO 2can be removed in the long term and through its storage can be\nused for chemical processes, allowing closed carbon cycles in the short term. For DAC, different\ntechnologies have been suggested in the literature, and an overview of these is proposed in this work.\nAbsorption and adsorption are the most studied and mature technologies, but others are also under\ninvestigation. An analysis of the main key performance indicators is also presented here and it is\nsuggested that more efforts should be made to develop DAC at a large scale by reducing costs and\nimproving ef\ufb01ciency. An additional discussion, addressing the social concern, is indicated as well.\nKeywords: atmospheric CO 2; direct air capture; CO 2reduction; CO 2removal; key performance\nindicators; carbon capture technologies\n1. Introduction\nRecent estimates report that CO 2emissions in the world were more than 33 Gton in\n2018 [ 1]. In order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, several international agreements\nwere signed: the Conference of the Parties (COP21) held at Paris on the 12 December 2015\nwas a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\n2/1.5\u000eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was con\ufb01rmed\nby the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\nnational determined contribution (NDC) was de\ufb01ned [ 3]. However, in order to achieve this\nobjective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\nnot enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\nFor this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\nremoval (CDR) technologies, will have a crucial role in the coming years to achieve the\nCO 2level de\ufb01ned by the environmental agreements and stabilize the CO 2concentration\nbetween 350 and 440 ppm [6,7].\nNegative emissions technologies are de\ufb01ned as the intentional human effort to remove\nCO 2emissions from the atmosphere and include the following: afforestation and reforesta-\ntion (AR), soil carbon sequestration (SCS), biochar (BC), bioenergy with carbon capture and\nstorage (BECCS), direct air capture (DAC), enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization\n(EW) and ocean fertilization (OF) [ 8]. Among these solutions, the research community has\nbeen focused for the most part on DAC, due to its advantages [9].\nDAC was used for decades to produce CO 2-free air to support life in submarines and\nspacecraft systems [ 10,11]; it was presented by Lackner as a GHG mitigation technology\nonly in 1999 [ 12]. DAC captures CO 2from the atmosphere to store it as part of a CDR\nprocess in the long term (direct air carbon capture and storage\u2014DACCS). Integrated\nDAC systems have also been studied to supply climate-neutral CO 2for chemical processes\nAppl.

DAC is independent of CO 2source location,\nbecause CO 2is distributed homogeneously throughout the atmosphere, minimizing or\neliminating CO 2transportation costs when the capture plant is situated near the utilization\nor storage site [ 16]; the capture plant can be located in a particular place where the the re-\nnewable energy can be exploited at the minimum cost [ 17]; DAC can tackle emissions from\nthe transport sector and other small sources that constitute about 50% of total emissions; air\nis ubiquitous, with few contaminants that could cause the degradation of solvents/sorbents\n(e.g., NO x, SO xand particulates) [18]; arable land is not required, avoiding loss of agricul-\ntural land [ 9]; the technology contributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development\nGoals (SDGs) 13, 9, 6 (by-product water could be used as fresh water in general), 8 (creation\nof new green jobs), 7 (exploitation of renewable energies), 11 and 12 (production of fuels\nand materials from atmospheric CO 2) and 3 (positive effect on health) [ 17]. However, there\nare also some disadvantages: the long term storage and sequestration of CO 2are critical\n(costs, long-term monitoring, potentially induced seismicity and leakage) [ 19]; low CO 2\npartial pressure in the air, about 400 ppm, 350 times lower than coal \ufb02ue gas so that large\nvolumes of air should be processed to capture a signi\ufb01cant amount of CO 2[7,13,20]; high\nenergy and cost requirements due to the dilute nature of CO 2in the air, requiring a large\nvolume of air to be treated [21].\nDAC technologies include absorption, adsorption, ion exchange resin, mineral car-\nbonation, membrane, photocatalysis, cryogenic separation, electrochemical approach and\nelectrodialysis approaches [ 6,18,22\u201326]. Absorption and adsorption technologies are the\nmost analyzed and studied in the literature [18].\nDAC technologies are characterized by thermodynamic issues related to the separation\nof CO 2from the air, which are more signi\ufb01cant than in the separation of CO 2from the \ufb02ue\ngas [ 27].

Alan Hatton4 & Haotian Wang1,2,5\u2009\u2709\nElectrochemical carbon-capture technologies, with renewable electricity as the \nenergy input, are promising for carbon management but still suffer from low capture \nrates, oxygen sensitivity or system complexity1\u20136. Here we demonstrate a continuous \nelectrochemical carbon-capture design by coupling oxygen/water (O2/H2O) redox \ncouple with a modular solid-electrolyte reactor7. By performing oxygen reduction \nreaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) redox electrolysis, our device can efficiently absorb dilute carbon dioxide (CO\n2) molecules at the high-alkaline \ncathode\u2013membrane interface to form carbonate ions, followed by a neutralization process through the proton flux from the anode to continuously output a high-purity \n(>99%) CO\n2 stream from the middle solid-electrolyte layer. No chemical inputs were \nneeded nor side products generated during the whole carbon absorption/release \nprocess. High carbon-capture rates (440\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122, 0.137\u2009mmolCO2\u2009min\u22121\u2009cm\u22122 or \n86.7\u2009kgCO2\u2009day\u22121\u2009m\u22122), high Faradaic efficiencies (>90% based on carbonate), high \ncarbon-removal efficiency (>98%) in simulated flue gas and low energy consumption (starting from about 150\u2009kJ per mol\nCO2) were demonstrated in our carbon-capture \nsolid-electrolyte reactor, suggesting promising practical applications.\nCO2 capture from dilute sources, ranging from industrial waste gas \nto atmosphere, plays an increasingly important role in managing \nglobal CO2 emissions and promoting downstream CO2 storage and \nuse1,3,8,9. Existing carbon-capture technologies (such as the amine \nscrubbing and Ca(OH)2/CaCO3/CaO+CO2 cycling process) typically \nrely on an energy-intensive and centralized thermal cycling process, \nin which elevated temperatures (as high as 900\u2009\u00b0C in the case of CaCO3 \ndecomposition) are needed to release the absorbed CO2 (refs.\u200910 \u201312). \nOther carbon-capture methods that use solid sorbents with high \nporosity and surface area, such as metal\u2013organic frameworks, have \nshown promising capture capacities but inferior cycling stability, \nespecially when exposed to humidity13\u2013 15. Although electrochemical \ncarbon-capture methods have gained attention as appealing alterna -\ntives owing to their high energy efficiency, decentralized operation, \nambient reaction conditions and ability to use renewable electricity, \nsubstantial challenges must be addressed before they can be widely \nimplemented3\u20135,16\u201318.\nIn general, electrochemical carbon capture relies on either \nredox-active carriers or pH swing to absorb and release CO2. The \nredox-active carriers, such as quinones, have high energy efficiency \nowing to their facile reaction kinetics involved in binding and releasing \nCO2 molecules under reduced and oxidized states19,20. However, their \npractical applications are still limited by low capture rates (typically \n<10\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122) and sensitivity to O2 gas present in most CO2 sources. On \nthe other hand, pH-swing methods using salt or water electrolysis to separate alkaline and acidic solutions, for CO2 absorption followed by \nacidification to release CO2, have been reported to be insensitive to O2 \nand can deliver larger currents (about 100\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122)2,18 ,21,22. However, \nthe decoupling of the electrolysis process from the CO2 absorption \nprocess requires energy-intensive downstream gas\u2013liquid contacting \nprocesses, especially under low CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, \nby-products such as H2 (from water splitting)23 or Cl2 (from NaCl elec-\ntrolysis)24,25 generated in different pH-swing designs add complexity \nand challenges to decentralized carbon capture.\nHere we report a different carbon-capture design by coupling O2/\nH2O electrolysis with our porous solid-electrolyte (PSE) reactor7 for a \ncontinuous and modular CO2 capture from a wide range of CO2 sources \nat industrially relevant capture rate, high energy efficiency, no O2 sen -\nsitivity and easy scalability and adaptability. As shown in Fig.\u00a01a, our \nsolid-electrolyte reactor comprises an ORR (O2\u2009+\u20092H2O\u2009+\u20094e\u2212\u2009=\u20094OH\u2212) \ncathode and an OER (2H2O\u2009=\u2009O2\u2009+\u20094H+\u2009+\u20094e\u2212) anode, which are sepa -\nrated by a compact, but porous, solid-electrolyte layer to allow effi -\ncient ion conduction (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). By performing this OER/\nORR redox electrolysis, the system does not consume or produce any \nchemicals, as the generated O2 from the anode can be recycled back \nto the cathode for a stoichiometric balance. To avoid flooding, an \nanion-exchange membrane (AEM) and a cation-exchange membrane \n(CEM) are inserted between the electrodes and the PSE layer. When \nO2 molecules get reduced by an active ORR catalyst (such as commer-\ncial Pt/C) on the cathode, large numbers of hydroxide ions (OH\u2212) are https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06060-1\nReceived: 1 May 2022\nAccepted: 6 April 2023\nPublished online: 28 June 2023\n Check for updates\n1Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA. 2Department of Materials Science and NanoEngineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA. \n3Canadian Light Source Inc., University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. 4Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, \nUSA. 5Department of Chemistry, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA. 6These authors contributed equally: Peng Zhu, Zhen-Yu Wu. \u2709e-mail: htwang@rice.edu960  | Nature | Vol 618 | 29 June 2023\nArticlegenerated at the catalyst\u2013membrane interface, which react rapidly \nwith the CO2 molecules in the stream to form carbonate or bicarbonate \nions (Fig.\u00a0 1b). These carbonate ions, driven by the electric field, then \nmigrate across the AEM into the PSE layer. Meanwhile, water on the \nanode side is oxidized to generate the same amount of O2 that gets \nconsumed and releases protons (H+) that travel across the CEM into \nthe middle layer to compensate the charge. These crossover carbonate \nand proton ions are recombined to form CO2 gas again, which can be \ncontinuously pushed out and collected in its high-purity form through \na recycling water flow through the PSE layer (Fig.\u00a0 1c).\nOur solid-electrolyte carbon-capture design presents several advan -\ntages over reported electrochemical carbon-capture methods. First, \nunlike some redox-active carriers that can be poisoned by the coexist -\ning O2 gas6, our proposed system fully uses O2 through ORR to create \na strong interfacial alkaline environment for effective CO2 capture26. \nSecond, there are no specific chemical inputs (other than water) or \nconsumption during the capture process, as the device performs ORR/\nOER redox electrolysis. Third, the triple-phase boundary created at \nthe cathode of our solid-electrolyte reactor allows for rapid diffu -\nsion of CO2 in the gas phase towards the catalyst\u2013membrane inter -\nface26\u201328, enabling the reactor to operate under large current densities \nfor fast CO2 capture while still maintaining high Faradaic efficiencies. \nThis is different from the traditional pH-swing method, in which the \nliquid-phase mass diffusion limits the rates of CO2 adsorption (through \ngas\u2013liquid contact). Fourth, the capture system can take advantage \nof past advancements in fuel cells and water-splitting catalysts for \nhigh energy efficiencies and easy scalability. Finally, our PSE device \nenables a continuous, simultaneous and integrated carbon-capture \nand release process, which differs from traditional absorption/desorp -\ntion cycles and simplifies the carbon-capture system for many on-site \napplications (Fig.\u00a0 1d).Concept verification\nTo validate the proposed CO2-capture mechanism, we used commercial \nPt/C and IrO2 as the electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, respectively29. \nDifferent CO2:O2 ratios were used to establish a fundamental under -\nstanding of the intrinsic CO2-separation performance of the system \n(Methods and Supplementary Figs.\u00a02 and 3). As shown in Fig.\u00a02a, the \nORR/OER I\u2013V curves under different CO2 concentrations were similar, \nsuggesting that the O2 concentration instead of the CO2 concentration \ndetermines the cell activity. The onset potential (under 0.5\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122) \nis around 0.8\u2009V, including OER and ORR overpotentials (around 200\u2013\n300\u2009mV each), ohmic drops and pH overpotentials during electrolysis3. \nUnder high current density, at which O2 mass diffusion starts to affect \nORR activity, the I \u2013V curve (without iR compensations; Supplementary \nFig.\u00a04) of 4.6%\u2009CO2 showed slightly better cell voltage than that of 8.6% \nor 13.9% owing to its higher O2 partial pressure.\nUnder a constant ORR/OER electrolysis current, we can obtain the \nCO2-capture rate, which is equivalent to the CO2 crossover rate, by meas -\nuring the CO2 flow rate out of the PSE layer using water-displacement \nand titration methods for both the gas-phase and dissolved CO2 \n(Methods and Supplementary Figs.\u00a05\u20137). This CO2 dissolution can be \navoided in practical operations by continuously recycling the deion -\nized water stream. The CO2 bubble formation within the PSE layer \nwas found to have little impact on the middle-layer pressure or the \ndevice operational stability (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08). Furthermore, the \nrecovered gas product was confirmed to be high-purity CO2 through \ngas chromatography analysis (up to 99.7% without considering water \nvapour; Supplementary Fig.\u00a09), allowing for direct integration with \ndownstream utilization or storage processes without the typical \nenergy-intensive secondary purification processes.

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone\u2013hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35\u00a0nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520\u00a0mV at a current density of 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, comparable to 530\u00a0mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90\u00a0mV dec\u22121, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2\u2212</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2\u2212</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications.

Compared to conventional chemical scrubbing, electrochemically mediated carbon capture utilizing redox-active sorbents such as quinones is emerging as a more versatile and economical alternative. However, the practicality of such systems is hindered by the requirement of toxic, flammable organic electrolytes or often costly ionic liquids. Herein, we demonstrate that rationally designed aqueous electrolytes with high salt concentration can effectively resolve the incompatibility between aqueous environments and quinone electrochemistry for carbon capture, eliminating the safety, toxicity, and at least partially the cost concerns in previous studies. Salt-concentrated aqueous media also offer distinct advantages including extended electrochemical window, high carbon dioxide activity, significantly reduced evaporative loss and material dissolution, and importantly, greatly suppressed competing reactions including under simulated flue gas. Correspondingly, we achieve continuous carbon capture-release operations with outstanding capacity, stability, efficiency and electrokinetics, advancing electrochemical carbon separation further towards practical applications.\nIntroductionAnthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions present a serious challenge to our society. One of the foremost mitigation strategies involves carbon capture, particularly from large stationary emission sources, followed by sequestration or utilization1,2,3,4,5. The incumbent technology for carbon capture is wet chemical scrubbing, which utilizes aqueous amines to chemically absorb CO2 and subsequently release it by desorption via a temperature-swing process. However, this process is challenged by the substantial energy demand associated with the regeneration step, sorbent degradation, corrosion, environmental concerns and large footprint3,6. To this end, emerging materials such as water-lean solvents and porous solid sorbents have also been garnering widespread attention, with many showing promising capture properties7,8,9,10. Nevertheless, most of these CO2 storing materials are still reliant on high pressure and/or temperature-swing conditions during their operation cycles10. Electrochemically mediated separations offer a low-temperature, ambient-pressure alternative for carbon capture, representing a promising yet largely unchartered research area11,12,13,14,15,16. By being electrically driven, these systems can be controlled precisely to reduce energy losses, are modular and thus easy to implement in a variety of locations, and possess great adaptability to the multiscale nature of carbon capture.In one form of electrochemically mediated carbon capture, redox-active organic compounds serve as CO2 carriers. Electrochemical reduction of these compounds generates nucleophiles with a high binding affinity towards electrophilic CO2 to afford stable sorbent-CO2 adducts; subsequently, the adducts can be oxidized to liberate pure CO2 while regenerating the sorbents13. To date, several classes of redox-active compounds have been explored, with quinoid species being the most representative example16,17,18,19,20. Quinones are a class of cyclic compounds containing two carbonyl groups in an unsaturated six-membered ring structure, which have been studied extensively for their key roles in biological electron transport as well as for promising applications in catalysis and energy storage21. They are versatile molecules with highly tailorable electrochemical properties through molecular engineering and can be synthesized from inexpensive commodity chemicals, which is favorable for large-scale applications22. Moreover, quinones as CO2 sorbents can have an appealingly high theoretical capacity of two CO2 equivalents per molecule, compared to conventional wet scrubbing which requires two equivalents of amine to capture one equivalent of CO2. Mizen and Wrighton23 first reported that electrogenerated 9,10-phenanthrenequinone dianion can chemically react with CO2 in homogeneous solutions to yield bis(carbonate), and further studies expanded the quinone chemistries for reversible CO2 capture-release16,17,18,24,25. Despite this progress, electrochemically mediated CO2 separations still need to be operated using mainly flammable, toxic aprotic organic electrolytes, posing a great barrier toward practical implementation13. Recently, the relatively benign ionic liquids have also been explored as electrolytes for electrochemically mediated CO2 separations16,18. While it may not be a major issue for batch-based separation processes with lean electrolytes, the often-expensive ionic liquids can raise serious cost concerns in continuous-flow absorption systems where they are needed in excess for the dissolution of redox-active CO2 carriers.An aqueous electrolyte is the ideal medium for large-scale electrochemical systems, offering distinct advantages in cost, safety, environmental benignity, and ease of device construction. Carbon capture via redox-active sorbents in aqueous electrolytes is, however, confronted with serious challenges. One critical limitation originates from the narrow electrochemical stability window of water, which is insufficient to support the reductive addition of CO2 to quinone molecules without incurring parasitic reactions (hydrogen evolution)23,26. Compared to aprotic solvents, aqueous media are complicated by the speciation of CO2 upon dissolution, which can undermine the activity of dissolved molecular CO2 given inappropriate solution pH15. Importantly, various competing reactions with reduced quinone molecules are expected in aqueous solutions, particularly protonation and ion association, hindering severely the kinetics and efficiency of carbon capture13,27,28,29. Finally, rapid evaporative loss is a long-standing concern when interfacing aqueous electrolytes with continuous gas flow, which can seriously compromise the service life of the electrochemical systems30.Herein, by drawing inspiration from the recent breakthrough in salt-concentrated electrolytes for battery applications, we develop an aqueous electrolyte formulation that is fully compatible with quinone-mediated electrochemical carbon capture26,30,31,32. Salt-concentrated aqueous electrolytes, also known as \u201cwater-in-salt\u201d electrolytes, are defined as those in which dissolved salt outnumbers water by both mass and volume26. In these solutions, the number of water molecules is insufficient to fully solvate the cations so that no free-state water exists, which can effectively suppress the activity of water molecules to extend the electrochemical stability window. By selecting appropriate salt species, desirable solution pH can be realized so that the total dissolved inorganic carbon is composed primarily of molecular CO2. It is worthwhile highlighting that, compared to their dilute counterpart, reduced quinone dianions are thermodynamically more reactive towards CO2 and less prone to competing reacti",
