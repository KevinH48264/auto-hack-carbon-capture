Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone\u00e2\u20ac\u201ccarbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40\u00e2\u20ac\u201c90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\nBroader context\nThere is a clear scientific consensus on the role of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the unusually wild fluctuations of global climate patterns over the last century, to which carbon dioxide is the largest contributor. This has generated a scientific tide in the study of carbon removal techniques over the last three decades, which has slowly gathered momentum, culminating in the 2015 Paris Agreement, which heavily emphasized the role of carbon removal by tackling emissions or via negative emissions technologies. While a path forward for carbon capture is being shaped by a mix of incumbent actors and newcomers, the great majority of the proposed processes rely on conventional concepts. Moreover, most of these processes have a large balance of plant which hinders their potential to flexibly adapt to the multi-scale nature of carbon capture. Herein, we demonstrate a new approach which presents a paradigm shift in adsorption type processes and carbon capture. The electro-swing basis of our process allows its linear scaling with desired capacity and lends it geometric flexibility. It also allows carbon capture from streams of any concentration, and its release into any carrier streams, including pure CO2, with a low balance of plant.\nIntroduction\nWith the alarming increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and its implications for global climate pattern developments,1,2 mitigation of climate change through curtailment of anthropogenic CO2 emissions has been one of the most urgent socioeconomic and scientific problems in the global arena over the last decade.3 To this end, a number of technologies have been developed for the large-scale capture of CO2 from combustion and other industrial processes to produce high-purity CO2 streams for storage or valorization.4 The most mature of these technologies are solvent scrubbing, mainly amine scrubbing,5 and oxyfuel combustion,6 which target high CO2 concentration streams",
    "Based on the related information, the potential limitations and problems with the proposed carbon capture approach are as follows:\n\n1. Limited information on scalability: While the approach is described as having linear scaling with desired capacity and geometric flexibility, the related information does not provide specific details or data on the scalability of the system. This lack of information may indicate potential challenges in scaling up the technology for large-scale carbon capture.\n\n2. Lack of information on cost-effectiveness: The related information does not provide any information on the cost-effectiveness of the proposed system. The cost of implementing and operating the system is a crucial factor in determining its viability and widespread adoption. Without this information, it is difficult to assess the economic feasibility of the approach.\n\n3. Durability and long-term performance: The related information mentions that the electrochemical cells used in the system show less than 30% loss of capacity after 7000 cycles. While this is a positive indication of durability, it is unclear how the system would perform over an extended period of time. Long-term performance and durability are important considerations for any carbon capture system.\n\n4. Limited information on environmental impact: The related information does not provide detailed information on the environmental impact of the proposed system. It is important to consider the overall environmental footprint of the system, including factors such as energy consumption, waste generation, and potential emissions associated with the manufacturing and operation of the system.\n\n5. Lack of comparison to other carbon capture technologies: The related information does not provide a direct comparison of the proposed system to other existing carbon capture technologies. Without this comparison, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the proposed system is more efficient in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) technologies.\n\nIt is important to note that these limitations and problems are based solely on the information provided in the related information section. Additional information or research may provide further insights and potential limitations."
