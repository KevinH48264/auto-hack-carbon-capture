    "1. Mass transfer limitations: The transport of CO2 into the porous electrode is the rate-limiting step in the carbon capture process. This can result in slower capture rates and broader breakthrough profiles.",
    "2. Variation in channel width: Imperfect packing of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to variation in channel width, causing uneven distribution of flow and overlapping breakthrough profiles.",
    "3. Sluggish electron transfer: The CVs of the polyanthraquinone-carbon nanotube (PAQ-CNT) composite electrodes show sluggish electron transfer, which can affect the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system.",
    "4. Electrode degradation: Over time, the electrochemical cells may experience degradation, resulting in a loss of capacity. This can be due to electromigration of shorter polymer chains from the electrode and into the electrolyte.",
    "5. Energy requirements: The energy required for the capture and release of CO2 can vary depending on the flux of CO2 and the rate of reduction of the quinones. Lower CO2 fluxes can result in higher energy requirements.",
    "6. Channeling effects: Improper assembly of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to channeling, where some channels bypass the active cells. This can result in lower overall efficiency and incomplete capture of CO2.",
    "7. Sensitivity to oxygen: The presence of oxygen in the feed stream can cause oxidation of the reduced quinones, reducing the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system. Careful tuning of the electron density of the quinone polymer is required to avoid reactions with oxygen.",
    "8. Complex flow systems: The electrochemical cell system eliminates the need for complex flow systems, but the assembly and design of the contactor bed can still be challenging and require careful optimization.",
    "9. Limited capacity: The capacity of the electrochemical cells and contactor bed is limited by the amount of quinone material and the overall size of the system. Scaling up the system may require additional optimization and engineering considerations.",
    "10. Limited applicability: The electrochemical cell system may not be suitable for all carbon capture applications, as it is primarily designed for capturing CO2 from flue gas and other CO2-rich streams. Other carbon capture scenarios, such as removing CO2 from enclosed spaces or low concentration streams, may require different approaches.",
    "11. Limited capacity: The system has a limited capacity for CO2 capture, as indicated by the rectangular adsorption isotherm. This limits the degree of regeneration of the adsorbent and the partial pressure of the recovered CO2 in the sweep stream.",
    "12. Mass transfer limitations: The system may experience mass transfer limitations, as indicated by the breakthrough profiles in flow system experiments. This can affect the uptake of CO2 by the activated electrodes.",
    "13. Energy losses during release: The release of CO2 from the system incurs energy losses due to the quasi-reversible nature of the reduction reaction in an electrophile-rich environment like CO2. The more positive the release potential, the larger the overpotential and the faster the release, but the less energy is recovered during discharge.",
    "14. Partial release at high discharge potentials: High discharge potentials can result in partial release of CO2 due to the partial oxidation of the bis(carbonate) quinone units. This can lead to underutilization of anthraquinone and incomplete regeneration of the adsorption bed.",
    "15. Complex electrode chemistries: The electrode materials used in the system, such as poly(1,4-anthraquinone) and poly(vinylferrocene), may have complex synthesis and preparation processes, which can add complexity to the overall system.",
    "16. Limited faradaic efficiency: Although the system demonstrates a faradaic efficiency of >90%, there is still room for improvement in terms of increasing the efficiency of the electrochemical reactions involved in CO2 capture and release.",
    "17. Durability concerns: The durability of the electrochemical cells used in the system is reported to show <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cycles. While this is promising, further studies are needed to assess the long-term durability and stability of the cells under various operating conditions.",
    "18. Energy consumption: The reported energy use for the system ranges from 43 to 90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, depending on the bed utilization and release potential. While this is on par with other carbon capture systems, further optimization is needed to reduce energy consumption and make the system more efficient.",
    "19. Techno-economic feasibility: While an initial techno-economic analysis suggests that the carbon capture system can be economically feasible with costs ranging from $50-$100 per tonne of CO2, further analysis and optimization are needed to assess the economic viability of the system for different applications and feed concentrations."
