ABSTRACT : New strategies for the sustainable synthesis of redox -active organic polymers could lead to next -generation organic 
electrode materials for electr ochemical energy storage , electrocatalysis , and electro -swing chemical separations . Among redox -active 
moieties, benzils or aromatic 1,2 -diones are particularly attractive due to their high  theoretical  gravimetric capacities and fast 
charge/discharge rates . Herein, we demonstrate that the c yanide -catalyzed polymerization of simple di aldehyde  monomers  unexpect-
edly leads to insoluble redox -active benzil -linked polymers instead of the expected benzoin polymers,  as confirmed by solid -state 
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electrochemical characterization.  Mechanistic studies suggest that cyanide -mediated 
benzoin oxidation occurs by hydride transfer to the solvent, and that the insolubility of the benzi l-linked polymers protects them from 
subsequent cyanolysis.  The thiophene -based polymer poly(BTDA)  is an intriguing  organic electrode material  that demonstrates two 
reversible one -electron reductions with monovalent cations such as Li+ and Na+ but one two -electron reduction with divalent Mg2+. 
Furthermore, in lithium metal half cells, poly(BTDA)  possese s an experimental capacity of 106 mAh/g and  promising rate capabilities 
(64% capacity retention when the discharge rate is increased from 0.1 to 10 A/g ). As such, the tandem benzoin -oxidation  polymeri-
zation  reported here in represents a sustainable method for the synthesis of highly tunable and redox -active  organic  materials.  
INTRODUCTION  
Greenhouse gas emissions are rising rapidly , and a s a result  the 
world  must rapidly transition towards more renewable and sus-
tainable processes , particularly in the chemical manufacturing 
and energy production /storage  sectors .1,2 Key to these efforts 
are redox -active materials, which are required for applicat ions 
ranging from heterogeneous  electrocatalysis to electrochemical 
energy storage to electro -swing carbon capture.3–9 As such , the 
development of new flexible, lightweight, high -capacity, and 
tunable redox -active  materials is required to meet increasing 
global sustainability demands.  
Crystalline i norganic solids , such as  LiCoO 2 electrodes for  lith-
ium-ion batteries (LIBs)   and Cu-based electrodes for electro-
catalytic CO 2 conversion,  currently dominate industrial appli-
cations of redox -active materials.10–12 However, these materials 
suffer from several fundamental shortcomings, including low 
power densities, the use of scarce elements, lack of tunability,  
and large carbon footprints  due to unsustainable manufacturing 
and mining processes .12–14 For example , the crystalline inor-
ganic cathodes  employed in LIBs  suffer from  slow intercalation 
of charge -balancing cations , restricting their capacities at  fast 
charge/discharge rates . Further more, the high synthesis temper-
atures and energy -intensive extraction and refinement procedures  involved in the production  of inorganic solids  lead 
to significant carbon emissions.12–15  
Organic electrode  materials  containing electroactive moieties 
offer a number of potential advantages over inorganic elec-
trodes, including structural and compositional tunability, im-
proved sustainability, increased flexibility, and faster 
charge/discharge rate capabilities.8,9,16 –20 These features make 
organic electrode materials particularly promising for applica-
tions requiring high power densities or structural versatility , 
such as the inclusio n of Na+ or Mg2+ ions.16 However, organic 
materials  have struggled to supplant traditional  inorganic elec-
trodes  in the context of electrocatalysis4,5,7 –9 and energy stor-
age15,16 due to several limitations. Beyond challenges associated 
with solubility and poor electrical conductivity, many redox -ac-
tive organic polymers are also prepared using ex pensive pre-
cious metal catalysts ( e.g. Pd), limiting their scalability.14,17,19,20  
Recently, green methods for synthesizing redox -active organic 
polymers have emerged but remain comparatively limited in 
scope.21–25 In addition, the field has coalesced around a small 
number of redox -active moieties, such as aminoxyl radicals, 
diimides, and 1,4 -quinones,  unnecessarily limiting the design 
space for organic electrode materials.16,18,19  Thus, expanding the

 lexicon of gree n methods available for the synthesis of poly-
mers functionalized with novel redox -active moieties would 
lead to next -generation organic materials for electrocatalysis 
and energy storage .20 
Despite their promising feat ures such as high theoretical gravi-
metric capacities and fast charge/discharge rates , especially 
with alternative ions such as Mg2+ (Figure 1) , aromatic 1,2-dio-
nes or benzils  remain understudied  as organic electrode materi-
als.26–34 This is likely due to th e limited methods available for 
the incorporation of 1,2 -diones into polymeric materials , as 
most methods rely on  installing the 1,2 -dione into a complex 
monomer first followed by polymerization . We hypothesize 
that a straightforward and general route to a ccess polymers 
linked by aromatic 1,2 -diones would be via the benzoin reaction  
of simple aldehyde monomers35–37 followed by oxidation of the 
resulting benzoin moieties (Figure 1).27,38,39  Although underuti-
lized for the synthesis of polymeric materials,38,40–42 the benzoin 
reaction is an attractive method for polymer synthesis due to its 
atom economy, inexpensive catalysts ( e.g. KCN), and reversi-
bility, potentially allowing for access to crystalline materials  
such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs).  
Herein, we describe the fortuitous discovery that the synthesis 
of polymers using the cyanide  (CN−)-mediated benzoin reaction 
under air -free conditions leads directly to a new class of insol-
uble redox -active 1,2 -dione -linked polymers  without the need 
for external oxidants , as confirmed by spectroscopic and elec-
trochemical studies. Molecular mechanistic studies suggest that 
the CN−-mediated oxidation of benzoins to benzils likely occurs 
via hydride transfer to the  protic solvent —a side reaction that 
has been uninvestigated  or overlooked in molecular benzoin re-
actions . Further more , our studies demonstrate  that precipitation 
of the polymer from solution  during synthesis  is critical to min-
imize cyanolysis of the forme d benzil linkages. Characteriza-
tion of these new redox -active polymers confirms that  their re-
dox-activity can be tuned by changing the flanking aryl groups 
or the charge -balancing cation, and that they  retain high charge 
storage capacities (≥87 mAh/g) at f ast discharge rates (1.0 A/g)  
in lithium metal half cells . Overall, our work represents a sus-
tainable and generalizable  method for the synthesis of redox -
active organic materials.  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
Synthesis and characterization of poly(BPDA).  We bega n 
our investigation into benzoin polymerizations  using 4,4′ -bi-
phenyldialdehyde ( BPDA ) as a monomer and KCN as a catalyst 
to prepare a n insoluble  polymer designated as CORN -BP-1 
(CORN = Cornell University, BP = benzoin or benzil polymer) 
(Figure 2) and referred to here -in as poly(BPDA) . Small -scale 
polymerization reactions were carried out in screw -cap reaction 
tubes under dry N 2 to minimize competing oxidation of the al-
dehydes t o carboxylic acids.36 After filtration, the resulting in-
soluble polymeric materials were soaked in tetrahydrofuran 
(THF) to remove soluble impurities and dried under vacuum 
prior to analysis by Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR) infra-
red (IR) spectroscopy.  In all cases, significant conversion of 
BPDA  was confirmed by the disappearance of aldehyde C−H 
stretches in the ATR -IR spectra of the polymeric samples (see 
SI section 3 for details).  
An extensive evaluation of solvents confirmed that protic sol-
vents, i ncluding ethanol (EtOH) and ethylene glycol (EG), pro-
duced the highest yields of poly(BPDA)  (SI Table S1). Among the solvents tested, EG was chosen because it is a green solvent 
with a high boiling point.43 Further optimization of the KCN 
loading, reaction  time, and reaction temperature revealed that 
carrying out the polymerization at 120 °C with 0.50 equivalents 
of KCN for 96 h was ideal for maximizing the yield of  insoluble  
poly(BPDA)  (49%)  while minimizing the KCN loading (SI Ta-
ble S2). As such, a bulk s ample of poly(BPDA)  was prepared 
under these conditions for further evaluation (Figure 2 a; see SI 
sections 4 and 13 for details).  
Characterization of poly(BPDA)  by scanning electron micros-
copy (SEM, SI Figures S23 and S24), transmission electron mi-
croscop y (TEM, SI Figure S26a), scanning tunneling electron 
microscopy (STEM, SI Figure S26b) and powder X -ray diffrac-
tion (PXRD, SI Figure S33) confirmed that it is a microcrystal-
line pol ymer . In particular, the observed reflections by PXRD 
(λ = 1.5406 Å) corres pond to d spacings of 4.5 Å (2θ = 19.7 °), 
4.2 Å (2θ = 21.1 °) and 3.3 Å (2θ = 27.2 °), suggesting that the 
limited crystalline order in poly(BPDA)  likely arises from π –π 
stacking interactions.44 Furthermore, TEM confirmed the pres-
ence of long (~100 nm) st rands, consistent with the expected 1 -
dimensional polymeric structure  of this material  (SI Figure 
S26a). Unfortunately, the insolubi lity of  poly(BPDA)  precludes 
us from determining its average molecular weight.  Notably, en-
ergy-dispersive X -ray spectroscopy (EDS) established the ab-
sence of residual potassium  (and thus KCN) in the sample (SI 
Figure S25 and Table  S3). However, combustion analysis de-
tected small amounts of incorporated N ( 1%), presumably due 
to residual nitrile groups resulting from CN− attack during the 
benzoin reaction (SI Table S4). Together, these data confirm the 
conversion of BPDA  into a polymeric material under the opti-
mized reaction conditions.  
Unexpectedly, further characterization of poly(BPDA)  by 
cross -polarized magic angle s pinning ( CP MAS) 13C solid -state 
nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR), ATR -IR, and solid -state 
UV-Vis spectroscopies revealed that the initially assigned 
structure of a benzoin -linked polymer was likely incorrect (Fig-
ures 3a−c). Although resonances correspon ding to the ketone 
carbonyl (δ 198 ppm) and aromatic carbons (δ 118−152 ppm) 
were observed in the CP MAS 13C SSNMR spectrum of 
poly(BPDA) , the H –13C–OH resonance characteristic of the 
benzoin moiety at approximately δ 76 ppm was consistently not 
detected ( Figure 3a) , even  at different 1H–13C contact times (SI 
Figure S30). This is unexpected, as a secondary alcohol carbon 
bearing a 1H should yield a stronger 13C signal than a quaternary

ymer poly(BPDA)  under optimized reaction conditions. Model

 carbonyl carbon in cross -polarization experiments, especially 
with short 1H–13C contact times.45 Likewise, the ATR -IR spec-
trum of poly(BPDA)  lacks a n absorption  peak at approximately 
3300 cm−1 corresponding to the alcohol O−H stretch of benzoin 
(Figure 3b). Last, the solid -state UV -Vis absorption spectrum 
of poly(BPDA)  dispersed in BaSO 4 displayed a broad absorp-
tion peak centered around 350 nm  and extending into the visible 
region , which is inc onsistent with the poor absorbance of ben-
zoin in the visible region (Figure 3c).41 Indeed, while benzoin 
is a white solid, poly(BPDA)  is bright yellow (SI Figure S27), 
reflecting a greater degree of π-conjugation than would be ex-
pected for a  non-conjugated  benzoin -linked polymer.  
Based on the characterization data outlined above, we hypothe-
sized that poly(BPDA)  is actually primarily a benzil -linked pol-
ymer instead of the expected benzoin -linked material. Indeed, the CP MAS 13C SSNMR spectrum of poly(BPDA)  matches 
well with the corresponding spectra for an authentic sample of 
benzil (Figure 3a). As further support , benzil is a light -yellow 
solid with an absorbance maximum that is bathochromically 
shifted (λ max = 261 nm) compared to that of benzoin (λ max = 249 
nm). Furthermore , benzil displays  weak absorbance around 400 
nm while benzoin shows no absorbance in the visible region (SI 
figures S107 –S108).  This difference  is amplified in the UV-Vis 
absorption features  and the color  of poly(BPDA)  (Figure 3c) , 
as would be expected due to increased cross -conjugation in the 
polymer . Critically, solid -state cyclic voltammetry (CV) meas-
urements also revealed that poly(BPDA)  undergoes a reversible 
reduction at E 1/2 = 2.274 V vs Li/Li+ (Figure 3d). This finding 
is consistent with the solution -state redox behavior of benzil, 
which undergoes a reversible two -electron reduction in certain

 organic solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),29,46,47  
and inconsistent with that of benzoin, which undergoes  an irre-
versible one -electron reduction at more negative potentials 
(Figure 3d and SI Figures S111 and S112a). In more polar sol-
vents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), benzil undergoes 
two one -electron reductions separated by a small difference in 
formal pot entials (Figure 3d, SI Figure S112b). Furthermore, 
the reduction peak positions of benzil (2.157 V vs. Li/Li+) and 
poly(BPDA)  (2.274 V vs. Li/Li+) in DMSO  are comparable, 
suggesting that similar redox processes are taking place in both 
materials (SI Table S8). Although we cannot rule out the pres-
ence of trace benzoin linkages in poly(BPDA)  that cannot be 
detected spectroscopically, our findings suggest that predomi-
nantly benzil -linked polymers are fortuitously formed during 
the CN−-catalyzed polymerization of dialdehydes.   
It should be noted that  the IR spectrum of poly(BPDA)  contains 
a diagnostic carbonyl C=O stretch (1675 cm−1, broad), but the 
carbonyl stretches of benzoin (1679 cm−1) and benzil (1657 
cm−1, with a shoulder at 1673 cm−1) are nearly identical and thus 
cannot be used to distinguish between the two linkage chemis-
tries (Figure 3b). Likewise, the stretch at 1374 cm−1 in 
poly(BPDA)  could be attributed to an H –C–OH δ bend that is 
strong in benzoin, but this stretch is also present in benzil , and 
thus is not necessarily consistent with benzoin linkages either.  
As such, outside of the O−H stretch present in benzoin and ab-
sent in benzil and poly(BPDA) , IR spectroscopy is of limited 
use to distinguish between these two moieties.  
Mechanism of  in situ  benzoin  oxidation. Given the reported 
oxidation of benzoin derivatives using O 2 and strong base,48,49  
we wondered if an initially formed benzoin -linked polymer was 
being oxidized by adventitious O 2 in situ  or during the soaking process to yield benzil -linked poly(BPDA) . To test this possi-
bility, poly(BPDA)  was syn thesized in a N 2-filled (<1 ppm O 2) 
glovebox (poly(BPDA) -GB) using freshly vacuum -distilled 
EG to rigorously ensure that the reaction, washes,  soaks  and 
drying steps were all conducted in an O 2-free environment (see 
SI section 4 for details). After drying , poly(BPDA) -GB was 
packed into an NMR rotor in the glovebox prior to analysis by 
CP MAS 13C SSNMR under N 2. As shown in Figure 3a, 
poly(BPDA) -GB possesses a nearly identical 13C NMR spec-
trum as that of poly(BPDA)  synthesized outside of the glove-
box. Likew ise, the ATR -IR and UV -Vis spectra of poly(BPDA)

of the reaction of 1, showing that the benzoin condensation equilibrates very quickly (<5 min) to form 2 whereas the formation of 4 (pre-
sumably from 3) is much slower. b) Kinetic investigation of the cyanolysis of 3 indicates that the conversion of 3 into 4 occurs nearly 
instantaneously under the reaction conditions. 19F NMR was used in place of 1H NMR for these studies due to the lack  of diagnostic 1H 
resonances for benzil species. An internal standard of 1 -fluoronaphthalene was used for all 19F NMR experiments (not shown).  Ar = 3 -
fluorophenyl.  
  
 
 and poly(BPDA) -GB are also very similar (Figures 3b –c). This 
finding confirms that adventitious O 2 is not required to form 
benzil -linked polymers , and that the in situ  oxidation of benzoin 
linkages during the polymerization reaction must proceed via 
an alternative mechanism  that does not require O 2.  
To gain further insight into the mechanism governing benzil  
formation under  the standard polymerization conditions, molec-
ular model studies were carried out using 3 -fluorobenzaldehyde 
(1) as a surrogate f or BPDA  (Figure 4, SI Figure S74). Authen-
tic samples of the possible products 3,3′ -difluorobenzoin ( 2) 
and 3,3′ -difluorobenzil ( 3) were prepared for comparison (see 
SI section 7a for details). Reactions were conducted for 30 min 
under air -free conditions using 1 -fluoronapthalene as an inter-
nal standard, as extended reaction times were found to lead to 
significant decomposition (SI F igure S86; See SI section 7b for 
details). 19F NMR was employed in place of 1H NMR due to the 
lack of diagnostic 1H NMR signals for benzil species. Subject-
ing 1 to the standard reaction conditions produced 2 along with 
other unidentified species (Figure 4a , SI Figure  S76). However, 
3 was not detected. Similarly, subjecting 2 to the same condi-
tions produced a significant amount of 1 due to the reversibility 
of the benzoin reaction, but 3 was again  not observed ( Figure 
4b, SI Figure  S79). Notably, heating 2 in EG for 24 h in the 
absence of CN− produced only trace amounts of 3, further sup-
porting that adventitious O 2 alone is not responsible for benzil  
formation during the polymerization reaction (SI Figure S88).   Synthesis of several potential side products (s ee SI Section 7a 
for details) confirmed that the  major  unidentified species  in all 
cases  was ester 4 formed from reaction with the solvent EG 
(Figure 4). Based on this finding, we inferred that 3 forms and 
rapidly undergoes cyanolysis via a previously repo rted path-
way50,51  to form 1 (which can react further to produce 2) and 4 
(see SI Figure S84 for a proposed mechanism).  Indeed, subject-
ing 3 to the reaction conditions produced mostly 4, along with 
small amounts of 1 and 2 (Figure 4c, SI Figure S82).   
In situ  19F NMR studies of the reaction of 1 with CN− were next 
carried out to interrogate if 3 forms transiently under the reac-
tion conditions  prior to decomposition into 4 (Figure 5a). In 
these studies, the reaction mixture was transferred to a screw -
cap NMR tube in a N 2-filled glovebox and then placed in an 
NMR spectrometer that had been pre -heated to 120 °C (see SI 
section 7c for details). Equilibration of 1 and 2 through the ben-
zoin reaction  occurred within the first 5 min  of the reaction (Fig-
ure 5a, SI Figure S91). However, 3 was again not observed, 
even when the reaction was conducted for 24 h (SI Figures S92 –
S95). Notably, the decomposition of the products was slower in 
an NMR tube, as even after 24 h, 1 and 2 were still  detectable 
(SI Figure S94).  This is likely due to a lack of mixing in the 
NMR tube. 
To determine whether it is possible to observe 3 in the presence 
of CN−, we subjected 3 to similar conditions as above in a 
screw -cap NMR tube (Figure 5b). Intriguingly, 3 was again not 
detected  by 19F NMR ; instead,  only 1 and 4 were observed in a 
1:1.4 ratio. Consistently, although solid benzil could be ob-
served in the NMR tube at room temp erature, it was not suffi-
ciently soluble in EG to be observed by 19F-NMR, and any 3 
that partially solubilized quickly converted to 4, suggesting that 
the cyanolysis of 3 proceeds rapidly even at room temperature 
(SI Figure S98). Importantly, 4 was also ob served in the reac-
tion carried out with 1 (Figure 5a), although its  generation  was 
slower than the formation of 2 via the benzoin reaction .  
Based on th ese finding s, we propose a kinetic scenario in which 
1 and 2 rapidly equilibrate in the presence of CN− via the ben-
zoin reaction, followed by rate -limiting conversion of 2 to 3 and 
subsequent rapid cyanolysis of 3 to 4 in solution (Figure 6a). In 
this kinetic regime, it would be nearly impossible to detect 3 in 
solution. Other than 1, 2, and 4, the other  species detected by 
19F NMR disappeared upon aqueous work -up (SI Figure S 80), 
confirming that 1, 2, and 4 are the major isolable products  
formed under the reaction conditions. Importantly, these find-
ings suggest that the precipitation of insoluble poly(BPDA)  
during  the polymerization is essential to the successful for-
mation of benzil -linked polymers, as precipitation likely mini-
mizes subsequent cyanolysis of the benzil linkages to form re-
dox-inactive esters (SI Figure S98). 50,51 The protection from cy-
anolysi s is further supported by the fact that insoluble  3 was 
observed  during in situ  experiments at room temperature, yet no 
solubilized 3 was observed by 19F NMR (SI Figure S98).  
Based upon our finding that 4 (and, by implication, 3) is only 
observed in the presence of CN−, we hypothesized that CN− is 
required for the in situ  oxidation of benzoin  linkages to benzils  
(Figure 6a). This process likely involves reversible deprotona-
tion of the benzoin  alcohol (p Ka ≈ 12) by CN− (pKa of HCN  ≈ 
9) followed by hydride transfer, akin to the Cannizzaro reac-
tion.52 Consistently, previous computational studies have 
demonstrated that hydride transfer during the benzoin reaction 
is kinetically feasible,53 and benzil formation in the nominal

 absence o f O 2 has been observed experimentally as well .49,54  
The hydride acceptor could be a proton  from  the protic solvent 
to form H 2, another carbonyl group  to form an alcohol , or ad-
ventitious O 2.49 Comparison  of the 19F NMR spectra  of model 
reactions (Figure 4)  to those of 3-fluorobenzyl alcohol and 3,3′ -
difluorodihydrobenzoin suggests that these compounds are not 
present in any of the reaction mixtures, ruling out carbonyl -
based hydride acceptors (Figure S77, see SI section 7 for d e-
tails). Likewise, the formation of  benzil s under rigorously air -
free conditions suggests that O 2 is also not required for  benzoin  
oxidation  either . Critically, residual gas analysis (RGA) of the 
headspace of a polymerization  reaction  of BPDA  in progress 
revealed  significant H 2 formation above the background ( Figure 
6b and SI Figures S100 –S102; see SI section 8 for details). As 
such, it is likely that the solvent serves as a proton source to 
form H2 upon hydride transfer (Figure 6a). This finding  further 
supports that the hydride transfer is the rate -limiting step of ben-
zil formation during the polymerization reaction, as H 2 evolu-
tion was slow but evident over the entire course of the experi-
ment.  
Generality of benzil polymer synthesis.  To expand the scope 
of this polymerization reaction and access materials with poten-
tially improved electrical properties, we synthesized another 
1,2-dione -linked polymer, termed CORN -BP-2 and herein re-
ferred to as poly(BTDA) , from the bis(thiophene) linker  BTDA  
under similar conditions (Figure 7a, see SI Section 5 for de-
tails). In both EtOH and EG,  significant conversion of the mon-
omer into poly(BTDA)  was observed by ATR -IR (see SI Sec-
tion 5 for details). Thus, the synthesis of poly(BTDA)  was 
scaled up in b oth EG ( poly(BTDA) -EG) and EtOH 
(poly(BTDA) -EtOH ) for comparison , and these samples were 
characterized using the methods described above (see SI section 
6 for details).  Consistent with the findings for poly(BPDA) , CP 
MAS 13C SSNMR  (absence of a H –13C–OH resonance)  and 
ATR -IR spectra  (absence of  an O–H stretch ) support the for-
mation of thenils  instead of thenoins  in both poly(BTDA)  sam-
ples (Figure 8a–b). Furthermore, solid -state CV confirmed that 
poly(BTDA)  undergoes two reversible one -electron reduction 
processes  at 2.494 V and 2.099 V vs. Li/Li+, which are compa-
rable to those of thenil at 2.434 V and 2.008 V vs. Li/Li+, respec-
tively (Figure 8c, SI Figure s S123  and S139 , and Table S9).23 
Characterization of poly(BTDA)  by SEM (SI Figures S44 and 
S45) and PXRD (SI Figure S52) demonstrated that it is also a 
microcrystalline polymeric material. Finally, characterization 
of poly(BTDA)  by EDS revealed a lack of residual K from 
KCN (SI Figure S47 and Table S6), but combustion  analysis 
revealed trace N ( ~2%), possibly from residual nitrile groups incorporated during the polymerization (SI Table S7). The suc-
cessful synthesis of poly(BTDA)  indicates that the tandem ben-
zoin-oxidation reaction is a general method for the synthesis of 
polymers linked predominantly  by 1,2 -diones.   
Investigation of redox -activity. The high theoretical energy 
storage capacities of poly(BPDA)  (257 mAh/g) and 
poly(BTDA)  (243 mAh/g) make them attractive candidates for 
battery applications and competitive w ith other leading redox -
active polymers such as P14AQ (theoretical capacity of 260 
mAh/g, SI Table S10).15 Thus , we investigate d the potential  of 
poly(BPDA)  and poly(BTDA)  as cathode materials in CR -
2032 Li -metal half cells (see SI section 12 for details) . This sim-
ple, well -behaved system  allows us to probe useful properties 
such as  long-term redox stability  and fast charge/discharge ca-
pabilities  in a standardized manner . Each  polymer ’s perfor-
mance w as first assessed using composite electrodes cont aining 
30% active material, 60% CMK -3, and 10% polyvinylidene 
difluoride (PVDF) binder using 1.0 M LiTFSI in DMSO as the 
electrolyte solution (see SI section 12 for details). Although  
poly(BPDA)  demonstrated promising capacities (up to 134 
mAh/g) in prelim inary tests, continued cycling resulted in sig-
nificant capacity losses (SI Figure S135).  Gratifyingly, 
poly(BTDA) -EG demonstrated similar initial capacity (124 
mAh/g, Figure 8b) and rate capabilities as poly(BPDA)  (Figure 
S141), but with significantly impr oved capacity retention upon 
cycling  (67% vs. 45% after 100 cycles). Notably, 1H-NMR 
analysis confirmed the extremely poor solubility of  neutral  
poly(BTDA)  in DMSO -d6 (SI Figure S 150), potentially ex-
plaining its improved cycling  stability.   Both samples were fur-
ther tested as composites with 60% active material, 30% CMK -
3, and 10% PVDF binder, a composition that is more reflective 
of actual organic electrode materials (Table S10).   
The behavior  of poly(BTDA) -EG at high active mass loading 
was eval uated by assessing its capacity retention at faster dis-
charge rates (Figure 8d)  and its cycling stability  (SI Figure 
S143). Promisingly, poly(BTDA) -EG retained 64% of its ca-
pacity when the discharge rate was increased 100 -fold from 
0.10 A/g (84 mAh/g) to 1 0 A/g (54 mAh/g), using the twentieth 
cycle capacity at 0.10 A/g for comparison (Figure 8 d). After 
five discharge cycles at 10 A/g, >87% (74 mAh/g) of the origi-
nal capacity was recovered when the discharge rate was re-
turned to 0.10 A/g.  Similarly, in cycli ng studies at a discharge 
rate of 50 mA/g, poly(BTDA) -EG retained 73% of its capacity 
between the 10th and 100th cycles (Figure S142).  The perfor-
mance of poly(BTDA) -EG at different rates was also superior 
to that of  poly(BPDA)  (Figure 8d),  reflecting the advantage of 
being able to  readily  tune the flanking aryl groups of the 1,2 -
dione units using our polymerization strategy.   
We hypothesize that th e observed  capacity lo sses for 
poly(BTDA) -EG in both cycling and rate tests  is due to partial 
dissolution of the material during charging and discharging, 
which is  a well-known challenge  for organic electrode materi-
als.55–60 This is further suggested by the post -mortem CVs of 
both poly(BPDA)  and poly(BTDA) -EG (SI Figures S15 3–
S154), which indicate that the redox -activity of both polymers 
is maintained  after 100 cycles. In addition,  slight solution dis-
coloration was observed in the electrolyte solution of disassem-
bled cells after cycling. Other possible causes for the observed 
deviation from the theoretical capacit ies of these materials  in-
clude undetected trace benzoin linkages contributing to irre-
versible capacity, inactive terminal esters contributing dea d

 weight, and/or the inability of the polymer to effici ently stabi-
lize the negative charge associated with the fully reduced spe-
cies. In future work, we will  alleviate the partial solubility of 
these materials by cross -linking or by incorporation into poly-
meric networks,55,56,61 –64 which are common methods to over-
come this problem in redox -active organic materials.  
One of the most exciting features of organic electrode materials 
is that they can be readily adapted to work with almost any cat-
ion, including  those  such as Na+ and Mg2+ that are more abun-
dant than Li+,65–67 and their redox properties can be optimized 
by tuning hard -soft acid -base interactions.68–70 Indeed, p revious 
molecular studies have demonstrated that 1,2 -diones are prom-
ising  potential  electrode materials for Mg -ion batteries , because 
the two one -electron waves  observed with monovalent cations 
such as Li+ collapse into a single  two-electron reduction  wave  with Mg2+ cation s due to the excellent hard -hard match of the 
divalent cation and the reduced carbonyl groups.29 However, 
this promising feature has not been demonstrated in polymeric 
electrode  materials to date.   
To probe the potential suitability of poly(BTDA) -EG for elec-
trochemical energy storage or electrocatalysis with alternative 
ions, CVs were carried out with  various electrolytes (0.1 M 
LiClO 4, NaClO 4, KClO4, nBu4NClO4, and Mg(ClO 4)2 in 
DMSO ) at a sweep rate of 20 mV/s using a standard 3 -electrode 
set-up in a N 2-filled glovebox (Figure 8c, SI Figures S15 5–
S162). The data for Li+, Na+, and Mg2+ are included in Figure 
8c for clarity . Importantly, the reduction potentials measured 
for Li+ by CV were nearly identical between the 3 -electrode set -
up and in the CR-2032 half cells (Figure  8c, SI Figures S139 
and S155 , Tables S9 and S11).

 Changing cati ons had little impact on the potential of the first 
reduction peak, with the biggest difference (120 mV, 11.6 
kJ/mol) observed between hard Mg2+ and soft K+ (SI Figure 
S160 and Table S11).  The change in behavior was much more 
drastic for the second reduction peak  potentials  among the mon-
ovalent cations . Decreasing the charge density ( i.e., increasing 
the size) of the monovalent cation from Li+ to nBu4N+ resulted 
in a decrease in the magnitud e of the second reduction potential, 
from 2.031 V (Li+) to 1.899 V (Na+) to 1.740 V (K+) and 1.773 
V (nBu4N+) vs. Li/Li+, respectively ( SI Table S11 , see section 
12 for further  discussion on nBu4N+). This finding suggests that  
among monovalent cations,  Li+ best stabilizes the doubly re-
duced form of poly(BTDA) -EG due to the hard -hard match of 
the reduced carbonyl units and the Li+ cations.29,68 –70  
Intriguingly, switching from  monovalent cations  to divalent  
Mg2+ caused  the secon d reduction peak to dramatically shift to 
2.501 V vs. Li/Li+, leading the second reduction peak to almost 
merge with the first peak to reveal a nearly simultaneous two -
electron transfer  (Figure 8c). This finding suggests that Mg2+ 
best stabilizes doubly reduced poly(BTDA) -EG. Furthermore, 
the redox -activity  of poly(BTDA) -EG was better retained over  
100 CV  cycle s with Mg2+ compared to Li+, indicating Mg2+ also 
best minimiz es solubilizatio n of the  reduced  polymer (SI Fig-
ures S1 61–S162, see SI section 12 for further discussion ). This 
finding suggests that 1,2-dione -linked polymers may be prom-
ising organic electrode material s for incorporation into next -
generation Mg -ion batteries, which we w ill explore in future 
work.   
The tunability  of the reduction potentials  of dione -based poly-
mers  through exploiting hard-soft acid -base matching between 
the charge -compensating cation and reduced polymer is con-
sistent with previous  studies  in other systems .29,69,71,72 This tuna-
bility allows for a single versatile structure to be employed for 
applications requiring alte rnative ions  without having to design 
a new material for each cation.  
CONCLUSION  
The development of sustainable methods for the scalable syn-
thesis of redox -active organic materials  represents a fundamen-
tal barrier to the deployment of next -generation organ ic elec-
trode materials. During the attempted synthesis of benzoin -
linked polymers,  herein we report the serendipitous discovery 
that the  cyanide -catalyzed polymerization of dialdehydes leads 
to redox -active 1,2 -dione -linked materials instead . These re-
sults demonstrate that the benzoin reaction is a viable method  
for the sustainable synthesis of modular , redox -active polymers . 
Furthermore, our electrochemical studies reveal that 1,2 -dione -
linked materials such as poly(BTDA) are viable candidates for 
electroc hemical energy storage due to their promising cycling 
stability and good retention of capacity at fast discharge rates.  
Intriguingly, the use of CN− in molecular systems  also results in 
low yields of the desired benzoin products , because of potential 
in situ  oxidation and cyanolysis, even under rigorously air -free 
conditions, a phenomenon previously unreported or attributed 
to adventitious oxygen.48,54 Therefore, our findings also have 
important potential implications for related reactions involv ing 
cyanide and other nucleophilic catalysts in combination with al-
dehyd e substrates .35,36  Future work will focus on minimizing the 
solubility of these materials through cross -linking or incorpora-
tion of 1,2 -diones  into less soluble materia ls such as polymer 
networks or covalent organic framework s, decreasing the conductive additives in battery composites by improving the in-
trinsic conductivity of these materials,  and further optimizing 
their redox activities. Furthermore, the potential of t hese novel 
redox -active materials for electrocatalysis will be evaluate d.
