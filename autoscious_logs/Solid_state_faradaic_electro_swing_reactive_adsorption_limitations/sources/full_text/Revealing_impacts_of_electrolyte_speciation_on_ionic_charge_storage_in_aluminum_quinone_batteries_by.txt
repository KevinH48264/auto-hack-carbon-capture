Abstract  
Rechargeable aluminum -organic batteries are composed of earth -abundant , sustainable electrode materials while 
the molecular structur es of the organic materials can be controlled to tune their electrochemical properties . 
Aluminum metal batteries typically use electrolytes based on chloroaluminate  ionic liquid s or deep  eutectic solvents  
that are comprised  of polyatomic  aluminum -containing ions. Quinone -based organic electrodes store charge when 
chloroaluminous cations (AlCl 2+) charge compensate their electrochemically reduced carbonyl groups, even when 
such cations are not natively present in the electrolyte. However, h ow ion speciation in the electrolyte affects the 
ion charge storage mechanism, and resultant battery performance, is not well understood.  Here, we couple solid -
state  NMR spectroscopy with electrochemical and computational methods to show for the first time  that electrolyte -
dependent ion speciation significantly alters the molecular -level environments of the charge -compensating cations, 
which in turn influences battery properties. Using 1,5-dichloroanthraquinone  (DCQ)  for the first time as an organic 
electro de material, we utilize  dipolar -mediated solid -state NMR experiments to elucidate distinct  aluminum 
coordination environments upon discharge that depend significantly on electrolyte speciation . We relate DFT -
calculated NMR parameters  to experimentally dete rmined quantities , revealing insights into their origins. The results 
establish that  electrolyte  ion speciation impact s the local environments of charge -compensating chloroaluminous 
cations  and is a crucial design parameter for rechargeable aluminum -organi c batteries.  
Introduction  
Batteries composed of low -cost, safe, earth abundant, and highly recyclable materials are needed to secure the 
planet‚Äôs future energy needs. Much of this requirement will be large -scale grid storage necessitated by intermittent 
renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar.  Aluminum (Al) metal has many benefits  as a battery  electrode , 
including high earth crust  abundance  (8.23 wt.%),  large theoretical volumetric capacity ( 8046 mA h mL‚Äì1), low cost , 
and safety . Despite these advantages, aluminum batteries are still in their infancy , primarily because few electrolytes 
enable electro plating and stripping Al metal at room temperature . Rechargeable aluminum batteries  currently use 
chloroaluminate ionic liquid (IL) and IL analogue (ILA) electrolytes , whose Lewis acidic mixtures remove the native 
oxide layer and enable reversible electrop lating of Al metal .[1‚Äì6] However, chloroaluminate species are corrosive 
and reactive, while many positive el ectrode  materials are not (electro)chemically stable with used with them .[7]  
 
Organic battery electrode materials can be designed at a molecular level to tailor properties ranging from cell voltage 
to electrolyte compatibility . Aluminum -organic batteries  are of particular interest due to  the mutual benefits of 
abundance , safety,  and low cost of the electrodes .[8‚Äì19] Aromatic quinones are attractive as battery electrodes due 
to their inherent electrochemical redox activity and weak intermolecular bonds that allow ion transport with low 
energetic b arriers. A luminum -quinone batteries have primarily been studied using the Lewis acidic AlCl 3:[EMIm]Cl IL 
electrolyte, where aluminum is found as chloroaluminate anions  (AlCl 4‚Äì and Al2Cl7‚Äì). However , quinone -based  
cathode s in this electrolyte are generally reported to store charge via complexation of polyatomic chloro aluminous 
cations  (AlCl 2+),[8‚Äì11,15 ‚Äì17] but also as divalent AlCl2+ [12,13]  or even trivalent Al3+ [14]. The complexation of 
aluminum -containing cations poses a key question: how do the se electroactive cationic  species  form in an ele ctrolyte 
natively containing only chloroaluminate anions ? To date, just o ne study by Kao et al. [17] has been conducted on 
aluminum -organic batterie s using an alternative electrolyte , specifically the AlCl 3:urea ILA , where in addition to the  2 chloroaluminate anions,  neutral and cationic aluminum -containing species also exist : AlCl 2[urea] 2+, AlCl 3[urea] , and 
AlCl 3[urea] 2.[3,20]   The ion charge storage mechanism in this system was proposed to utilize the  AlCl 2[urea] 2+ cations 
directly , yet much remains to be understood about the charge storage mechanisms in this electrolyte.  Understanding 
the fundamental mechanistic processes underpinning these emerging battery chemistries is crucial for the scientific 
and technological  development of these battery system s.   
 
Solid -state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is  uniquely suited for studying charge storage 
mechanisms in aluminum -organic batteries . Protons are abundant in the electroactive organic molecules, which can 
be characteriz ed directly or used in heteronuclear dipolar -mediated NMR experiments  to probe other nuclei .[21] 
The 27Al nucl ide is also highly sensitive as it is  100% naturally abundant  and has a  high gyromagnetic ratio ( ùõæ = 
6.976 √ó107 rad s‚Äì1 T‚Äì1, receptivity  of 1.22x103 relative to 13C). Due to their  quadrupolar nature (spin-5/2), 27Al nuclei 
interact with local electric field gradients (EFGs),  yield ing complex  quadrupolar lineshapes resulting from the second -
order quadrupolar interactions that are  not averaged out by MAS. [22‚Äì24] Information on aluminum symmetry and 
ligation is encoded with in these quadrupolar lineshapes ; therefore , measuring and understanding quadrupolar 
parameters can yield critical insights into local  aluminum binding environments , such as those of  charge -
compensating  polyatomic aluminum cations.  Lastly, solid -state NMR enables analysis of heterogeneous battery 
electrodes containing both solid and residual liquid electrolyte , e.g., as recently demonstrated in Al -sulfur 
batteries. [25]  The advantage is two -fold: (i) solvent washing is mitigated which can otherwise  alter the sample, 
while (ii) the mobile ( liquid ) species can be selective ly filtered using  dipolar -mediated experiments  and/or by 
leveraging differences in nutation of the liquid and solid quadrupolar nuclei , revealing only the solid .[9,25]  Recently, 
Gordon et al. [9] used multi -dimensional solid -state NMR spectroscopy, including dipolar filt ers, to measure 
experimentally the ionic and electronic charge storage mechanisms in an Al -quinone  battery electrode (indanthrone 
quinone, INDQ), revealing electrochemical enolization and the tetrahedral nature of the charge -compensating 
chloroaluminous Al Cl2+ cation upon charge compensation.  To date, this remains the only solid -state NMR study of 
Al-quinone  battery systems.  
 
Here , we perform multi -dimensional  solid -state NMR measurements , in concert with  electrochemical techniques 
and DFT calculations , on aluminum  metal batteries using 1,5-dichloroanthraquinone (DCQ) as an organic cathod e 
material  to understand how  electrolyte speciation  affects the  ionic charge storage mechanism  up from the molecular 
level. DCQ was chosen as a small anthraquinone -based molecule  as it is expected to be generali zable  to existing Al-
organic battery literature using quinone -based electrodes , while its chlorine substituents result in  modestly 
improved  cell voltages  compared to anthraquinone .[26] Three  IL and ILA  electrolytes  were tested, which  each 
contain unique ion speciations that are shown to result in different local environments and distri bution s of the 
polyatomic aluminum cat ions complexing to DCQ . We couple solid -state NMR measurements with DFT calculations 
to identify probable configurations of the charge -compensating ions and to understand the thermodynamics of 
competitive reaction mechanisms  originating  from different electrolyte  species . 
Results and Discussion  
Three  different electrolytes with unique ion speciations were compared to systematically test existing hypotheses 
of the Al -quinone charge storage mechanism : (i) AlCl 3:[EMIm]Cl (1.5 :1 molar ratio ), (ii) AlCl 3:urea (1.3:1  molar ratio ), 
and (iii) AlCl 3:propionami de (1.3:1  molar ratio ). The AlCl 3:[EMIm]Cl IL contains Al2Cl7‚Äì and AlCl 4‚Äì, whereas the urea 
and propionamide  (PA)  ILAs contain Al2Cl7‚Äì, AlCl 4‚Äì, AlCl 2L2+, AlCl 3L and AlCl 3L2, where L = urea  or propionamide, 
respectively .[3,27]  It was previously proposed  that electroactive chloroaluminous AlCl 2+ cations  are produced from 
Al2Cl7‚Äì in aluminum -quinone batteries using AlCl 3:[EMIm]Cl  electrolytes .[9,15]  However , in electrolytes that contain  
polyatomic AlCl 2L2+ cations  alongside Al2Cl7‚Äì anions,  such as the ILAs , it is unclear how the ion charge storage reaction 
would proceed and what competition would exist in generating ions from the native electrolyte species . To study 
these effects up from the molecular level, solid -state NMR experiments were performed on DC Q electrodes 
electrochemically cycled in the  different electrolytes, including dipolar -mediated and multiple -quantum NMR 
measurements  (Figure 1) , the results of which  are discussed below.   3

two rotor periods from red -blue -green for a six -rotor -period supercycle . A minimum of two rotor periods are required for 
recoupling, and optimally multiples of six rotor periods should be used for completing the full supercycle .  
Electrochemical Cycling of Al -DCQ Cells.  Galvanostatic cycling was  first performed on Al-DCQ  cells wi th each of the 
three electrolytes  to characterize their electrochemical properties  (Figure 2). The theoretical capacity of a DCQ 
electrode is expected to be 193.4 mA h g‚Äì1, assuming a two -electron reaction per molecule of DCQ. These cells were 
fabricated without performance optimization measures such as melt -infused carbons [13] or functionalized 
separators [31] as our intention was to study how electrolyte  speciation affects the ion  charge storage mechanism.  
Based on results from similar  anthraquinone -based electrode materials , the carbonyl groups of DCQ are  
electrochemically  reduced upon discharge in an enolization reaction and are subsequently charge -compensated by 
AlCl 2+ ions. [9,11,12,15]

electrolytes performed at 10 mA g‚Äì1 and 60 ÀöC. Note the differences in the scale of the x-axes. 
 
DCQ discharged in the AlCl 3:[EMIm]Cl electrolyte yielded an initial specific discharge capacity of 200 mA h g‚Äì1, close 
to the theoretical capacity,  with a single, flat plateau  at a potential of 1.0 V (Figure 2a). The discharge capacities 
reduce d upon further  cycling , possibly a result of dissolution of partially charged DCQ molecules  in the 
 4 electrolyte, [31] which could be mitigated by oligomerizing or polymerizing DC Q. The first cha rge step had three 
distinct plateaus with an overall specific capacity more than double that of the discharge . The two higher potential 
plateaus are of unknown origin and are reduced i n subsequent charges, while  the overall charge capacity  becomes  
commensu rate with the reduced discharge capacities. For DCQ discharged in the ILAs, the initial discharge specific 
capacities are lower compared to  the IL : 68 mA h g‚Äì1 for AlCl 3:urea  (Figure 2b) and 120 mA h g‚Äì1 for AlCl 3:PA (Figure 
2c). In the AlCl 3:urea electrolyte , the flat discharge plateaus  at 1.0 V are followed by a long sloping profile . The 
AlCl 3:PA electrolyte demonstrates a similar behavior after cycle 1, though the sloping part of the curve is more 
pronounced. The sloping discharge profiles may be a result of disorder imparted to the electrode following the initial 
discharge.  Charge reactions for both ILAs  also exhibit higher potential plateau s, similar to  DCQ discharged in 
AlCl 3:[EMIm]Cl. For all electrolytes, the  overpotential for ion removal upon charge may be associated with ion -
assisted solvation of complexed AlCl 2+ ions and mass -transport limitations .[32] The galvanostatic cycling tests were 
performed at 60  ÀöC to mitigate impacts from differences in electrolyte conductivity and enhance electrochemical 
kinetics, enabling better comparisons of the ion charge storage mechanism .[20,33,34]  
 
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments follow ed similar trends to that of the galvanostatic cycling (Figure S 1). For 
example , the smallest currents were observed with  the AlCl 3:urea  electrolyte where as the AlCl 3:PA electrolyte 
yielded broad peaks commensurate with the sloping plateaus observed in its galvanostatic cycling. Interestingly, two 
sets of redox peaks are observed in  the CV curves for the AlCl 3:[EMIm]Cl  electrolyte , a result similar to that  using  
indanthrone quinone .[9] The reduction peak at ca. 0.3 V may be associated with EMIm+ cation decomposition and 
is discussed further below.   
 
Characterization of Pristine DCQ . Solid -state 1H and 13C NMR spectra of pristine DCQ powder were acquired , 
alongside powder X -ray diffracti on (XRD)  measurements, to characterize the material as a baseline (Figure 3).

(black) shown with the simulated pattern (red,  PDF# 00 -029-1666 ). Inset:  crystal structure of DCQ . 
 
The 1H spin -echo NMR spectrum (Figure 3a) yields one broad signal in the aromatic region.  Interestingly, the  1H T1 
relaxation time  is 655 s. This long longitudinal relaxation is typical for a rigid, crystalline material, as the DCQ 
molecules are highly ordered  with strong intermolecular interactions due to  both œÄ-œÄ stacking and halogen  
bonding .[35] The 13C{1H} cross -polarization MAS ( CP-MAS ) NMR spectrum (Figure 3b ; pul se sequence in Figure 1 c) 
shows  13C signals  in three groups: carbonyl ( carbon ‚Äò 1‚Äô), aromatic ( ‚Äò3‚Äô-‚Äò6‚Äô), and quaternary ( ‚Äò2‚Äô, ‚Äò7‚Äô).[36] The powder 
XRD pattern (Figure 3c) shows the crystallinity  of DCQ , consistent with its long 1H T1 relaxation time . The intense 
reflection at  a 2ùúΩ angle of 25.65¬∞, corresponding to a d-spacing of 3.56 √Ö, corresponds to  the interlayer spacing . 
 
Understanding Electrolyte Species by NMR.  Liquid -state 27Al single -pulse experiments were acquired under 
quantitative conditions to determine the aluminum  species in the pristine electrolytes  for both the Lewis acidic ratios 
 5 (Figure 4a,d,g) used  in electrochemical cells as well as  their Lewis neutral equivalents  (Figure 4b,e,h ). The aluminum 
species expected for all three electrolytes were observed : AlCl 3:[EMIm] contains AlCl 4‚Äì and Al2Cl7‚Äì,[33,37]  whereas  
AlCl 3:urea [3,38]  and AlCl 3:PA[27,34,39,40]  contain AlCl 4‚Äì, AlCl 2L2+, AlCl 3L, and AlCl 3L2 (where L is the ligand, either 
urea or propionamide) , as well as  Al2Cl7‚Äì. Significant line broadening is observed in the 27Al NMR spectra for the 
Lewis acidic mixtures (Figure 4a,d,g) ,  a result of rapid  chemical  exchange on the NMR timescale  facilitated by the 
presence of Al 2Cl7‚Äì. This effect is particularly pronounced for the AlCl 3:urea electrolyte, where all 27Al signals merge 
into one broad  signal .[27,33]  
 
DCQ electrodes were discharged in Al -DCQ cells (10 mA g ‚Äì1, cycle 3),  harvested , and packed into NMR rotors along 
with residual liquid electrolyte trapped within the electrode pores , uniquely enabling simultaneous , nucleus -specific  
characterization of both  the solid discharged electrode and  liquid electrolyte  remnants . The solid -state 27Al spin-
echo NMR  experiments (Figure 4c, f, i) were acquired with an rf  pulse length of œÄ/2 (w ith respect  to 1 M aqueous 
Al(NO 3)3), exciting predominantly the liquid  electrolyte  signals  because (i)  the solid 27Al signals are quadrupolar (see 
below) and nutate at a faster rate [41,42] , resulting in poor excitation over the two -pulse sequence, coupled with 
(ii) the faster transverse  T2 relaxation times of the solid 27Al environments,  working as a transverse relaxation  filter .  
Thus, to a first approximation, the 27Al spin -echo NMR measurements  selectively analyze s the residual liquid 
electrolyte in the pores of the solid discharged electrodes , which can be compared to the pristine Lewis acidic  
electrolytes  and their Lewis neutral equivalents.  Liquid -state 1H single -pulse NMR spectra of the pris tine electrolytes 
yielded 1H signals associated with EMIm+ cations, urea, or propionamide, as expected  (Figure S2).

electrolytes , and  (b, e, h) their Lewis neutral equivalents  (1:1), acquired at 7.05 T . (c, f, i) Solid-state 27Al spin-echo NMR spectra

signal assignments are indicated on the NMR spectra.  
 
Analyzing the 27Al NMR spectra reveals insights into aluminum ion speciation in the residual electrolytes  after 
discharge . The liquid -state 27Al spin-echo NMR spectrum of the Lewis acidic AlCl 3:[EMIm]Cl electrolyte (Figure 4a) 
exhibits 27Al signals corresp onding to AlCl 4‚Äì (103 ppm) and Al 2Cl7‚Äì (98 ppm), whereas the Lewis neutral electrolyte 
 6 (Figure 4b) contains only AlCl 4‚Äì. The solid -state 27Al spin -echo NMR spectrum of the discharged DCQ electrode  reveals 
that the residual electrolyte  contained  both  Al2Cl7‚Äì, and AlCl 4‚Äì (Figure 4c), indicating that it retains Lewis acidity upon 
discharge . The liquid -state 27Al single -pulse NMR spectra of the Lewis acidic AlCl 3:urea  and AlCl 3:PA ILAs (Figure s 
4d,g) exhibit  broad lineshapes due to  rapid chemical exchange facilitated by Al 2Cl7‚Äì in the electrolyte s, as noted 
above . The liquid -state  27Al NMR spectra of the Lewis neutral ILAs (Figures 4e,h) contain much sharper signals and 
bear striking resemblances to the solid -state 27Al spin -echo NMR spectra of the residual liquid from DCQ electrodes 
discharged in the respective electrolytes  (Figure 4f,i), establishing  that the  electrochemical  discharge process 
consumes Al 2Cl7‚Äì. This important result reveals that the Lewis acidic chloroaluminate  electrolytes lose Lewis acidity  
during cycling , becom ing more  Lewis neutral upon full discharge in DCQ cells, with greater consequence for the ILA 
electrolytes that have less Al 2Cl7‚Äì over all. This finding may help to explain the lower  specific capacit ies and worse  
electrochemical performance  of the ILA electrolytes  compared to the Lewis acidic AlCl 3:[EMIm ]Cl IL electrolyte.  
 
Molecular -Level Environments of  Aluminum Discharge Products.  Due to the overlap of 27Al NMR signals from solid 
and liquid species in the solid -state NMR  spectra  of the discharged electrodes , solid -state 27Al{1H} and 1H{1H} dipolar -
mediated NMR techniques  were used to selectively probe the solid aluminum discharge products . These dipolar 
filters  depend upon the through -space magnetic dipole -dipole interactions between nuclear spins, which in turn 
depend upon (i) through -space internuclear distances (probe sub-nanometer length scales) and (ii) relative 
molecular mobilities. Dipolar -mediated correlation or filtering experiments will not reveal nuclear spins that are far 
apart (> 1 nm) or experience rapid isotropic mobilities that average away the dipolar inte ractions. Here, we use solid -
state  27Al{1H} dipolar -mediated heteronuclear multiple -quantum correlation (D -HMQC ) NMR experiments  using the 
symmetry -based SR421 sequence (Figure 1d,e) , which reveal  27Al signals that are dipole -dipole -coupled with, and 
hence  in close molecular proximity to, the 1H signals of the DC Q molecules. This experiment thus reveals specifically 
the 27Al signals associated with the solid aluminum -DCQ discharge products. 2D 27Al{1H} D -HMQC NMR spectra 
(Figures 5a,e,i) measure through -space interactions between 27Al and 1H nuclei in different molecular -level 
environments. Separately acquired 1D 27Al{1H} D -HQMC  spectra  (Figures 5b,f,j)  acquired with greater signal -to-noise  
than the 1D project ions are plotted along the horizontal axis, along with solid -state 27Al single -pulse  spectra (Figures 
5c,g,k) acquired under quantitative conditions ( œÄ/12  pulse, fully relaxed between scans ) that show both solid and 
liquid signals.  In addition,  1D 1H{1H} dipola r-mediated double -quantum -filtered (D -DQF)  experiments using the BaBa -
xy8 sequence (Figures 5d,h,l; pulse sequence in Figure 1b)  are plotted along the vertical axis, which were used to 
filter the proton signals of residual electrolyte  and reveal only solid  1H signals.

acquired at 40 kHz MAS and 14.1 T . The quadrupolar 27Al environments I (red) and II (blue) are associated with AlCl 2+ complexed 
to DCQ . 
 
 7 The solid -state 2D 27Al{1H} D -HMQC NMR spectrum of DCQ discharged in Lewis acidic AlCl 3:[EMIm]Cl electrolyte 
(Figure 5a) yielded 2D correlated signal  intensities  between the 27Al environments in the tetrahedral shift region  at 
ca. 91 ppm (environment I) and 75 ppm (environment II) and the aromatic 1H environments centered at  7.5 ppm  
associated with DC Q, establishing their subnanometer -scale proximities . The  1D 27Al{1H} D -HMQC spectrum (Figure 
5b) reveals that the two 27Al environments , which  correspond to distinct tetrahedrally -coordinated solid discharge 
products,  exhibit  complex  lineshapes indicative of  ordered quadrupolar environments (confirmed by 2D 27Al{27Al} 
MQ-MAS experiments below) . These two 27Al environments are also observable in the quantitative  27Al single -pulse 
spectrum (Figure 5c), along with signals corresponding to residual liquid electrolyte species that are not observable 
in the 27Al{1H} D -HMQC experiments due to rapid molecular mobilities . The aromatic 1H signals centered at 7.5 ppm 
in the 1H{1H} D -DQF spectrum (Figure 5d) correspond to the 1H shift of DCQ protons  (Figure 3a). There are a dditional  
1H signals at 1.4, 1.6, 3.8, 4.0, 7.2, and 8.2 ppm  that exhibit heteronuclear 1H‚Äì27Al dipol e-dipole  interactions with 
27Al environments I and II, which are  associated with EMIm+ cations  and any of its electrochemical degradation 
products. [9,43]   Thus, EMIm+ cations are also immobilized and in close molecular proximity to coordinated aluminum 
species.  
 
An identical suite of solid -state NMR experiments acquired on DCQ discharged in the Lewis acidic AlCl 3:urea (Figure 
5e-h) or AlCl 3:PA (Figure 5i -l) ILAs reveal key differences that yield insights into the role of the organic electrolytes 
species on the molecular environments of the charge -compensating chloroaluminous cations. For the AlCl 3:urea 
electrolyte, 2D 27Al{1H} D -HMQC spectrum (Figure 5e) also exhibits 2D correlated signal intensity between 27Al signals 
associated with environments I and II and the DCQ 1H signals at 7.5 ppm, establishing their mutual interactions.  The 
1D 27Al{1H} D -HMQC spectrum (Figure 5f) clearly shows both distinct 27Al environments. Curiously, for DCQ 
discharged in the AlCl 3:PA electrolyte, the solid -state 1D 27Al{1H} D -HMQC spectrum (Figure 5j) reveals only one 27Al 
signal (environment II).  While the origin of this difference is not unknown, it must be linked to the structure of PA, 
which is more sterically bulky and hydrophobic compared to urea. The quantitative 27Al single -pulse spectra (Figure 
5g,k) indicate the Lewis neutral nature of  the residual liquid electrolytes and highlight the effectiveness of the 
dipolar -mediated experiments in filtering out the mobile liquid signals. Lastly, both the 1H{1H} D -DQF spectra (Figure 
5h,l) and 2D 27Al{1H} D -HMQC spectra (Figure 5e,i) do not reveal  the presence of appreciable 1H signals from AlCl 3L, 
AlCl 3L2, or AlCl 2L2+ species in the solid phase, or their interactions with aluminum environments bound to DCQ, unlike 
the EMIm+ cations.   
 
To confirm the quadrupolar nature of the 27Al environments and  understand their lineshapes , a 2D 27Al{27Al} 
multiple -quantum MAS (MQ -MAS) NMR experiment (pulse sequence in Figure 1 a) was performed on the DCQ 
discharged in Lewis acidic AlCl 3:[EMIm]Cl electrolyte . The 2D 27Al{27Al} MQ -MAS spectrum (Figure 6a) reveals two 
27Al signals with distinct quadrupolar lineshapes that are partially overlapping signals in the MAS dimension (Figure 
6b) but resolved in the isotropic dimension of the 2D spectrum. Slices were taken through the 27Al signals  in the 
isotropic dimension and the individual lineshapes were fitted using DMFit  [44] to obtain their NMR parameters. The 
simulated quadrupolar lineshapes using these parameters are shown (Figure 6c). E nvironment I (96.2 ppm, isotropic 
dimension) had a qu adrupolar coupling constant CQ of ca. 3.5 MHz and an asymmetry parameter Œ∑ of 0.32, while 
environment II (98.8 ppm, isotropic dimension) had a C Q of ca. 7.7 MHz and Œ∑ of 0.59. Given the symmetrical 
structure of DCQ, it is interesting that two distinct 27Al environments are observed. The complexing ion is expected 
to be AlCl 2+, based on the tetrahedral coordination environment of Al; therefore, there must exist at least two locally 
stable configurations of AlCl 2+ with distinct electric field gradients (EFGs) .  Furthermore, these environments can be 
affected by electrolyte  ion speciation, as D CQ discharged in Lewis acidic AlCl 3:PA electrolyte did not exhibit a 27Al 
signal similar to environment I, as discussed above.

DFT Calculations Establish Links Between Physical Properties and NMR Parameters.  To gain further insight into the 
origin of the different 27Al environments and their quadrupolar lineshapes, DFT calculations were performed on 
systems of quinones with chloroaluminous AlCl 2+ cations in different positions and coordination environments .[45] 
DFT-calculated chemical shielding and EFG tensors were obtained and used to predict the 27Al shifts and quadrupolar 
coupling constants, enabl ing comparison s to experimental data.  For the simulations, p-benzoquinone (BQ) was used 
in lieu of DCQ as a general model for  quinones and to reduce computation al expense . AlCl 2+ species were aligned 
with BQ oxygens and placed between two BQ layers . The quinones were aligned with the bottom BQ molecule lying 
flat on the x-y plane.  Interlayer spacing of the quinones ( z-axis) and lateral spacing of the AlCl 2+ ions ( y-axis) were 
independently varied  (Figure 7a,b), respectively . The resultant  total  27Al isotropic  shifts and quadrupolar coupling 
constants  are plotted as mean  values  for each interlayer spacing , averaged over  AlCl 2+  lateral displacements of 1, 
1.25,  1.5, 1.75,  2, and 2.25 √Ö with respect to the  complexing quinone oxygen , with the range of values and standard 
deviations shown as lighter and darker shaded areas, respectively  (Figure 7c).  
 
The total isotropic 27Al shift Œ¥isototal is calculated as the sum of  the isotropic chemical shift  Œ¥isoCS, the second -order 
quadrupolar shift  Œ¥iso2Q, and the isotropic nucleus -independent chemical shift (NICS) Œ¥isoNICS:

The nucleus -independent chemical shift Œ¥isoNICS reflects the shift induced by ring -current effects from adjacent 
aromatic molecules. [50] Ring current effects contribute to magnetic shielding and will result in a negative shift. The 
effect is expected to be greater at small interlayer spacings and as the nucleus of interest moves from the edge to 
the center of the aromatic ring system. [48,50]  These effects will be  more significant in larger aromatic systems  and 
are expected to have only minor  contributions to the model  system  studi ed here .

(b) changing AlCl 2+ lateral displacement.  (c) Calculated total isotropic 27Al shifts (black triangles) and quadrupolar coupling 
constants (red squares) of BQ-coordinated AlCl 2+ cations with varying interlayer spacings, each computed for lateral 
displacements of 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, and 2.25 √Ö. The mean valued are plotted with range s and standard deviations shown as 
lighter and darker shaded regions , respectively.  
 
The isotropic 27Al shifts and quadrupolar coupling constants are highly d ependent upon BQ interlayer spacing and 
lateral displacement of the AlCl 2+ cation. The calculated mean total isotropic 27Al shifts initially increase with 
increasing interlayer spacings to a maximum at 5 √Ö, decrease until 8 √Ö, before modestly increasing un til 10 √Ö . As 
discussed above, this shift  is a combination of different  terms  (Figure S3). Powder XRD measurements of DCQ 
indicated an interlayer spacing of 3.56 √Ö for the pristine material , which decreas es upon discharge to 3.30 √Ö (in both 
AlCl 3:[EMIm]Cl, and AlCl 3:urea electrolytes) and 3.21 √Ö (in AlCl 3:PA electrolyte) (Figure S4). From the XRD 
measurements, the experimental  interlayer spacings are  thus ca. 3.2-3.3 √Ö.  The calculated  total isotropic 27Al shift s 
for these interlayer spacings are within the range of  the experimentally determined 27Al shifts  of 91 and 75 pp m, for 
Al environments I and II, respectively , and are highly dependent upon lateral spacing . The DFT calculations predict 
that the magnitude of  CQ increases as the quinone layers separate, a direct consequence of a loss of symmetry about 
the 27Al nucleus  as the AlCl 2+ cations move from  a tetrahedral geometry  to a distorted tetrahedra, and ultimately to 
an unfavorable two -coordina te geometry . As the  interlayer spacing increases, the magnitudes of CQ converge to a 
maximum  of approximately -17 MHz  as the configuration and electronic environment around the 27Al nucleus 
 10 becomes less influenced by the increasingly distant quinone layers . Similarly , the effect s of lateral displacement 
become less significant  at high er interlayer spacings , as indicated by the decreasing range and standard deviation . 
As with the total isotropic 27Al shifts, the experimentally measured C Q values of 3.5 and 7.7 MHz for Al environments 
I and II are within the  calculated range of values for an interlayer spacing of ca. 3.2-3.3 √Ö.  While the DFT calculations 
of this model system do not reveal the precise molecular configurations giving rise to Al environments I and II, they 
do shed light on the different configurations possible and the variables that affect the 27Al shifts and quadrupolar 
parameters.  
 
At small  interlayer spacings, there are large variations in CQ and subsequently Œ¥iso2Q depending on the lateral spacing 
of AlCl 2+, which in turn  lead s to large variation s in Œ¥isototal. The variation of interlayer spacings and lateral displacements 
can be collapsed geometrically into an estimated  Al-O bond length  since the Al -Cl bond lengths and Cl -Al-Cl bond 
angles are held  constant  in the calculations . When the calculated CQ values were plotted as a function of Al -O bond 
length  and fit to a curve , values of 1.78 and 1.95 √Ö were obtained for the C Q values determined for environments I 
and II, respectively (Figure S 5a), within the expected range of Al -O bond lengths (1.7 -2.2 √Ö). [51] A similar analysis 
was performed using the calculated asymmetry parameters as a function of Al -O bond length, where the asymmetry 
parameters  found for environments I and II would correspond to  Al-O bond lengths of  2.01 and 2.18 √Ö , respectively 
(Figure S 5b). Therefore, the  Al‚ÄìO bond lengths predicted by these analyses fall within the anticipated range , though  
the magnitudes of quadrupolar coupling constants calculated on AlCl 2+ in BQ appear to be generally overestim ated  
when using this approach compared to that measured in DCQ via NMR spectroscopy .  
 
Thermochemical Calculations Predict Ion -Generation Pathways.  Energies of the electrolyte species and reaction 
products were also obtained from DFT optimization calculations of the  relaxed structures , enabling assessment of 
the most  favorable reaction pathway for electroactive cation production via thermochemical computations . 
Reaction enthalpies for three pathways of producing AlCl 2+ cations were calculated according to

The results were calculated at 298.15 K and are tabulated below (Table 1).  The experimental reaction product is not 
an isolated AlCl 2+ cation, but rather AlCl 2+ complexed to electrochemically reduced DCQ ; to simulate this effect in a 
computationally efficient manner, AlCl 2+ was fixed into a tetrahedral geometry, rather than allowing it to relax into 
a linear geometry. T hese calculations are thus  a first -order approximation though  the trends are expected to be 
general izable.  Reaction energies were also calculated for Al 2Cl5+ as an alternative cation ic reaction product , however, 
the energies required to produce these ions were far less favo rable, while the NMR shifts and C Q values calculated 
were in worse agreement with the experimental data (Figure S 6, Table S1 ).

Reactio n #1 is possible in all electrolytes, whereas  reactions  #2 and #3 are possible only in the ILAs .  ŒîHÀö rxn and ŒîGÀö rxn 
are negative for each reaction  and their magnitudes increase from reaction #1 to reaction #3. These reaction 
energies signify two major outcomes: firstly, the production of AlCl 2+ is energetically favorable , as indicated by the 
negative Gibb‚Äôs free energy for all reactions ; secondly, t hat reaction #3 is the most energetically favorable pathway  
in the ILAs , a result also commensurate with the loss of Al 2Cl7‚Äì from the electrolyte observed in the  solid -state  27Al  11 spin-echo  NMR spectra  of the discharged DCQ electrodes  (Figure 4f,i). Note that reactions #2 and #3 involves the 
generation of neutral ligands (i.e., urea or PA) at the electrochemical interface during the discharge process.   
 
The Al 2Cl7‚Äì anions are  necessary for  the efficient electro plating of Al metal, so the consumption of this 
chloroaluminate species can reduce the specific capacity  by limiting the  charge -compensating electro plating 
reaction at the anode  that occur ring during charging:  
 
4Al2Cl7‚Äì+3e‚Äì‚áÑAl+7AlCl4‚Äì       (7) 
 
Thus, i f the usable Al 2Cl7‚Äì is consumed by the cathodic discharge reaction  and not replaced,  the electrolyte becomes 
less Lewis acidic,  and the battery will cease to charge .  
 
This effect was also probed for the ILA electrolytes, as it has been proposed that aluminum electro plating can occur 
from the AlCl 2L2+  cation, for example, according to  [3] 
 
2[AlCl2‚àô(urea )2]++3e‚Äì‚áÑAl+AlCl4‚Äì+4(urea )     (8) 
 
An analogous electrochemical reaction is expected to occur in the AlCl 3:PA electrolyte. We test ed this hypothesis by 
attempting to galvanostatically cycle a n Al-DCQ cell with a Lewis neutral AlCl 3:PA (1:1)  electrolyte, where reactions 
#1 and #3  (Table 1)  are not possible due to the absence of Al 2Cl7‚Äì anions in the electrolyte  (Figure S 7). The initial 
discharge reaction can occur without Al 2Cl7‚Äì, further verifying the feasibility of reaction #2 . However, the average 
discharge potential is ca. 0.53 V and, which is lower than the 1.0 V potential achieved by  the Lewis acidic AlCl 3:PA 
(1.3:1) electrolyte , indicating a greater overpotential . While the overpotential can have multiple origins , this 
observation is consistent with the larger overpotentials  measured by Abood et al.  using Lewis neutral ILAs  [39] and 
further suggests the fa vorability of  reaction # 3 over reaction # 2, consistent with the thermochemical calculations. 
Importantly, the cell using th is Lewis neutral  ILA electrolyte was unable to achieve a  reasonable charge capacity , 
resulting in rapid failure  in subsequent  cycle s. As the only Al 2Cl7‚Äì anions present in the electrolyte would be those 
generated during discharge, the results also suggest  that the aluminum electroplating reaction is much more facile 
from the Al 2Cl7‚Äì anion ( Equation 7 ) compared to the AlCl 2L2+ cation ( Equation 8 ).  
 
In summary, the calculations  indicate that the overall electrochemical reaction occurring at DCQ in Lewis acidic 
AlCl3: [EMIm ]Cl ionic liquid is :

While  the reaction in  Equation 9  is possible i n a Lewis acidic AlCl 3:L ionic liquid analogue  (L = urea or propionamide) ,

Conclusion  
Electrolyte speciation is shown  for the first time  to significantly impact the molecular -level coordination 
environments of charge -compensating chloroaluminous (AlCl 2+) cations in Al-organic batteries.  DCQ was used  as a 
model anthraquinone -based cathode, while Lewis acidic AlCl 3:[EMIm]Cl, AlCl 3:urea, and AlCl 3:propionamide  (PA)  
electrolytes were used  as electrolytes.  Solid -state 27Al NMR experiments , including dipolar -mediated and multiple -
quantum methods, revealed  that charge -compensating AlCl 2+ cations complexed to DCQ exists in two tetrahedr al 
aluminum environments  with distinct quadrupolar lineshapes when discharged in AlCl 3:[EMIm]Cl  and AlCl 3:urea   12 electrolytes , whereas only one aluminum environment was observed when using the  AlCl 3:PA electrolyte. The results  
establish an electrolyte dependent ionic charge storage mechanism . This difference may be explained , at least in 
part,  by the impact that the larger size of propionamide versus urea has on DCQ interlayer spacing.  Liquid -state and 
solid -state 27Al NMR experiments indica ted that residual electrolyte in DCQ discharged in the Lewis acidic AlCl 3:urea 
and AlCl 3:PA ionic liquid analogues becomes Lewis neutral , which significantly affects battery performance .  DFT 
computations yielded estimated values  of 27Al NMR shift s and qua drupolar parameters of AlCl 2+ cations in different 
interlayer spacings and lateral displacements, enabling the experimental data to be  correlated to possible physical 
origin s. Thermochemical calculations identified  possible  reaction  pathways to generate AlCl 2+ from the electrolyte, 
including the most favorable, revealing in particular the synergistic roles of Al 2Cl7- and AlCl 2L2+ (L = urea, PA) in the 
electrochemical discharge  mechanism  in the ionic liquid analogues . The calculations  are consistent with 
galvanostatic cycling of DCQ in ILAs with different Lewis acidities. The results may also be applicable to other 
multivalent metal -organic battery systems, which involve complex ion solvation structures and desolvation 
pathways.

Methods  
Electrolyte Preparation . The electrolytes were synthesized in an argon -filled glove box (< 1.0 ppm of H 2O and O2). 
Solutions were prepared by slowly adding AlCl 3 (ThermoFisher Scientific, 99.999%) to 1 -ethyl -3-methylimidazolium 
chloride ([EMIm]Cl (TCI, >98.0%), urea (Acros Organics, >99.5%), or propionamide (Acros Organics, 97%) with 
constant stirring until the desired molar ratios were achieved  (1.5:1, 1.3:1, and  1.3:1, respectively) . Due to the 
exothermic reactions  that occur upon addition of AlCl 3, the vial was placed in a Peltier thermoelectric cooler (Techne 
No ICE chiller) filled with ceramic -coated cooling beads to regulate temperature and mitigate thermal d ecomposition 
during mixing. After addition of AlCl 3, the vial was placed on a hot plate at 60oC and stirred until homogenous.  
 
Composite Electrode Fabrication . 1,5-dichloroanthraquinone (DCQ) electrodes were prepared by ball milling DCQ 
powder ( 65 wt%; TCI, >95.0%) with carbon black (25 wt%; Super P , Alfa Aesar, 99%) for 1 h. Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) 
(PTFE) binder (10 wt%; Aldrich, 1 ¬µm particle size) was added and mineral spirits were added as required  to form a 
paste (DCQ:Super -P:PTFE mass rat io of 65:25:10) . The mixture was calendered at a thickness of approximately 0.5 
mm, after which it was then calendered to a final thickness of 110 ¬µm  and dried under vacuum at 60  ¬∞C overnight . 
Final electrode mass loadings were ca. 9.2 mg cm‚Äì2. 
 
Cell Assem bly. Cells were constructed in PTFE Swagelok unions of 0.25  in. (6.35 mm) and 0.5  in. (12.70 mm) 
diameters inside an argon -filled glove box (< 1.0 ppm of H 2O and O 2). The smaller cells were used for electrochemical 
measurements, whereas the larger cells were used to harvest electrodes for further characterization . Cells were 
assembled using a  DCQ composite cathode , glass microfiber separator ( Whatman GF/D) , and aluminum  anode 
(99.99% Alfa, 0.1 -mm thick), with molybdenum current collectors for both electrodes. 6 -mm and 11-mm diameter  
DCQ and aluminum electrodes were used for the 0.25 and 0.5 in. Swagelok  cells , respectively . 50 and 150 ¬µL of 
electrolyte  was used for the s maller and larger cell sizes , respectively . Three -electrode c ells for cyclic voltammetry 
measurements were constructed in 0.25 in. -diameter Swagelok cells with an Al wire reference electrode, which was 
fed through a hole drilled in the center of the PTFE body.  
 
Electrochemical Measurements . Galvanostatic cycling tests were performed in an Arbin Instruments LBT battery 
cycler using a voltage range of 0.20‚Äì1.95 V. Cyclic voltammetry tests were performed a t 0.5 mV s‚Äì1 using a BioLogic 
VSP-300 potentiostat using a voltage range  of 0.05 ‚Äì2.45 V. The open -circuit potential for Al -DCQ cells was 
approximately  1.3 V after  assembly.   13  
X-ray Diffraction (XRD). XRD measurements were performed  on a PANalytical X‚ÄôPert Pro powder diffractometer 
with a Cu KŒ± radiation source (Œª = 0.544 nm). A scan rate of 0. 4¬∞ min‚Äì1 was used to scan a 2Œ∏ range of 9.5¬∞‚àí 60¬∞.  
 
Liquid -State NMR Spectroscopy . Liquid -state NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AVANCE III HD 300 NMR 
spectrometer with a 7.05 T  narrow -bore  (54-mm)  bore superconducting magnet equipped with a 5 -mm multinuclear 
broadband fluorine observe (BBFO) probe, operating at 300.13 MHz for 1H an d 78.204 MHz for 27Al nuclei . All liquid -
state 27Al and 1H single -pulse spectra were acquired under quantitative conditions using (i) a radiofrequency field 
strength of  25 kHz field strength ( ùúã/2 of 10 ¬µs)  and 16.7 kHz ( ùúã/2 of 15 ¬µs), respectively, and ( ii) recycle delay s of 
‚â•0.5 s  and 2 -15 s, respectively,  which were calibrated such that all nuclear  spins relaxed to thermal equilibrium  (5*T1, 
the longitudinal relaxation time ). Samples were prepared in a n argon -filled  glovebox (< 1.0 ppm of H 2O and O 2) with 
coaxial tubes containing an isolated D 2O locking solvent ; both tubes sealed with epoxy to ensure no ingress of air  
upon removal from the glovebox . 
 
Solid -State NMR Spectroscopy . Solid -state NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AVANCE III HD 600 NMR 
spectrometer with a 14.1 T narrow -bore (54-mm) superconducting magnet operating at 600.140 MHz for 1H, 156.378 
MHz for 27Al, and 150.910 MHz for 13C nuclei . A Phoenix NMR 1.6 -mm HXY magic -angle -spinning (MAS) probehead 
was used, where all measurements on discharged electrodes were conducted at 40 kHz MAS , while  measurements 
on pristine DCQ were conducted at 35 kHz MAS . Air was pumped through the probehead at 600 L h‚àí1 and 298.1  K to 
mitigate MAS -induced sample heating. 1H and 13C shifts were referenced with respect to tetramethylsilane (TMS) at 
0 ppm by using adamantane as a secondary chemical shift reference. 27Al shifts were referenced to a 1 M aqueous 
Al(NO 3)3 solution at 0 p pm.  
Solid -state 27Al single -pulse MAS NMR experiments were performed under quantitative conditions by  using  (i) short 
œÄ/12 rf pulses  (0.31 ¬µs)  to ensure linear excitation of all solid and liquid signals  and (ii) recycle delays of 0.25 -0.40 s 
such that all 27Al nuclear spins relax to thermal equilibrium (>5 √ó T1). 27Al rf pulses were calibrated on  1 M aqueous 
Al(NO 3)3 where  an rf field strength of 135 kHz (œÄ/2 of 1.85 ¬µs)  was used for all broadband pulses . 27Al spin -echo 
experiments were perfor med using 4 rotor periods in the full -echo delay to optimize liquid signal intensity vs. the 
solid signal intensity. 27Al{1H} D -HMQC  experiments were performed using the SR421 symmetry -based recoupling 
scheme, which recouples 27Al-1H dipolar interactions while simultaneously decoupling 1H-1H homonuclear 
interactions.  Central -transition (CT) selective  pulses used a 27Al rf field strength of 10.4 kHz ( œÄ/2 of 24 ¬µs) . SR421 
recoupl ing pulses  used  a 1H rf field  strength  of 80 kHz (2√ó MAS frequency). Preparatory , diverging  27Al double -
frequency sweep (DFS) pulses were used to achieve up to three -fold signal enhancements. DFS pulses were swept 
from 50 kHz to 1 MHz prior to each scan.  27Al{27Al} MQ -MAS experiments were performed using a three -pulse 
sequence with excitation and conversion rf pulses of 3.5 ¬µs and 1.1 ¬µs, a CT -selective œÄ/2 readout pulse  of 24 ¬µs, 
and a z-filter delay of 25 ¬µs . Triple -quantum to single -quantum coherence selection was obtained via phase cycling.  
All solid -state 1H NMR experiments used  an rf field strength of 161 kHz  (œÄ/2 of 1.55 ¬µs) for all broadband pulses . 
1H{1H} D -DQF experiments were performed using  the BaBa -xy8 scheme for DQ excitation and conversion . The 1H 
spin-echo experiment performed on pristine DCQ used a 2 -rotor -period full -echo delay  and was used to eliminate 
probe 1H background signals . 13C{1H} CP -MAS experiments were acquired using  a zero -quan tum (n = +1) Hartmann -
Hahn matching condition achieved by fixing the 1H rf field at 87.5 kHz (5/2√ó MAS  rate of 35 k Hz) and optimizing the 
13C spin -locking power around a 13C rf field of 52.5 kHz (3/2 √ó MAS). CP contact times of 4 ms were used.  
 
Computatio nal Calculations . DFT calculations were performed in Gaussian 09 using the 6 -31G+(d,p) basis set and 
the hybrid B3LYP method (Becke‚Äôs three -parameter nonlocal exchange functional and Lee‚àíYang‚àíParr‚Äôs correlation 
functional). [45] Structures with positional constraints were built in Avogadro [52,53]  before performing gauge -
independent a tomic orbital (GIAO) calculations in Gaussian 09  to determine the chemical shielding properties and 
the electric  field gradient (EFG) eigenvalues. The EFG eigenvalues were arranged such that | Vxx|<|Vyy|<| Vzz|. To 
reduce computational expense, structures without constrained positional parameters were first  roughly optimized 
with the UFF forcefield in Avogadro, before being optimized a second time in Gaussian 09  using the 6 -31G+(d,p) level 
of theory . NMR parameters were calculated as discussed above.  Chemica l shielding was referenced to Al3+(OH 2)6 at 
611 ppm.
