Abstract  
 This study provides insights into structure -property relationships of Nafion membrane s swollen

 Introduction  
Perfluorinated sulfonic acid membranes  (PFS As) have enabled substantial  performance 
enhancement s and cost reductions in electrochemical  energy conversion  systems  such as proton exchange 
membrane  (PEM)  hydrogen fuel cells , redox -flow batteries,  and water electrolyzers by playing a dual role 
as a separator and ion -conducting media that prevents crossover of chemical species between the cathodic 
and anodic sites while providing  a low-resistance pathway  for prot on transport1–4.  Ionic conductivity in 
PFSAs is intimately related to their nanostructure d morphology dictated by  phase separat ion between a 
hydrophobic fluoropolymer matrix and acidic side -chains. This nanostructure is highly sensitive to 
environmental conditions; most critically, external water drives formation and hydration of acid -rich 
clusters which swell and percolate into a n interconnected hydrated ionomer network5. The relationships 
between hydration, nanostructure, and key transport properties including conductivity, water transport, gas 
permeability, and mechanical streng th in PFS As have been investigated rigorously for decades and are 
highly relevant for the aqueous electrochemical systems in which they have historically been employed1,2,6,7. 
The advantages  afforded by ionomer membranes  in hydrogen fuel cells and water electrolyzers 
have been extended to  CO 2 electrolysis8–11, direct -methanol fuel cells (DMFCs)12–14, electro -organic 
synthesis15–17, and electrochemical swing absorbers18. These devices  expose membranes to  more complex 
chemical envir onments  (i.e., multiple organic and inorganic chemical species)  than a fuel cell or water 
electrolyzer , which interact with and impact the PFSAs structure and transport properties . Motivated by the 
need to understand structure -property relationships of ion -conducting membranes in the presence of organic 
chemical species , this study  explore s the effects of organic sorbates ranging from pola r alcohols to nonpolar 
alkanes on the swellin g, ionomer nanostructure and ionic conductivity of Nafion ™ membranes.  The results 
reveal that both macroscopic and nanoscopic swelling are strongly dependent on sorbate polarity , with a 
large but poorly -defined ionomer doma in-network  in alcohol -saturated N afion l eading to low ionic 
conductivity despite high sorbate uptake. These changes in the ionomer phase separation persist with the 
introduction of water  in the presence of organic sorbates , leading to unique solvent -structure -property relationships that d iffer from the well -understood water -Nafion relationships . The insights  of this study will 
help guide  the development and implementation of ionomers for emerging organic  electrochemical devices . 
Results and Discussion  
Ion transport in Nafion emerge s due to complex multiscale physicochemical interactions between 
water and the fluoro polymer. In hydrated Nafion, water solvates sulfonic acid groups, dissociati ng protons 
as mobile charge carriers. The geometry of the ionomer domains is determined by a bal ance between  water 
sorption  in the hydrophilic regions  opposed by deformati on of the fluoropolymer matrix  during swelling2,19. 
Macroscopic  PFSA conductivity is highly sensitive to water content as both the morphology of ionomer 
domains and the concentration/mobility of ions within those domains are linked to hydration levels . Both 
of these factors are expected to change when Nafion is swollen with organic species ; size and polarity of 
the sorbing species have been shown to impact bulk swelling (and likely the ionomer domain structure)20–
25 and the polarity, pKa, and viscosity would impact th e concentration and mobility of protons.  
Figure 1 shows the ionic conductivity of Nafion membrane vapor -equilibrated  with water (bl ack 
squares), methanol ( teal triangles), ethanol ( orange  circles), isopropanol (purple diamonds)  and octane  
(yellow hexagrams ) from the vapor phase . For all alcohols , Nafion showed nonlinear scaling of ionic 
conductivity with increasing  concentration of sorbate  in the vapor phase; a trend  consistent with the impact 
of water uptake  on PFSA ionic conductivity. On the other hand,  Nafion showed  minimal sorbate uptake 
and negligible ionic conductivity  when exposed to vapor of nonpolar alkanes ( see Table S1 in the supporting 
information  for uptake data ). For the alcohols studied , the maximum sorb ate volume fraction ( 𝜙max) 
increased wi th decreasing solvent polarity ( 𝜙max, water < 𝜙max, MeOH  < 𝜙max, EtOH < 𝜙max, iPrOH ), opposite of the 
molar solvent uptake ( Table S1,  supporting information). This is consistent with prior literature21,26 –28 and 
attributed to t he balance between solvent/solute interaction energy (more favorable for more polar solvents) 
and mechanical deformation induced by swelling, leading to small molar uptake but large volume expansio n 
for large solutes like iPrOH. Alcohols can also plasticiz e the fluoropolymer matrix enabling high er swelling 
ratios  than water swollen membranes29. Conductivity at a given solvent volum e fraction, however, scaled with solvent polarity ( 𝜅water > 𝜅MeOH > 𝜅EtOH > 𝜅iPrOH). This is consistent with consideration of each solute as 
a mobile  electrolyte phase within the ionomer domains , with conductivity given by  𝜅=𝑛𝐹𝐶𝐻+𝜇𝐻+ where 
n is the charge of a proton, F is Faraday’s constant, 𝐶𝐻+ is the proton concentration, and 𝜇𝐻+ the proton 
mobility.  Saito et al. demonstrated that 𝜇𝐻+ is the dominant factor in determi ning ionomer ionic 
conductivity and  decreas ed logarithmically with alkyl chain length  for Nafion swollen with alcohols21. 
However, this scaling is complicated by  morphological considerations in PFSAs where  solvent uptake plays 
a critical role in the percolation of ion -conducting domains , and where  for a given  sorbate  the PFSA ionic 
conductivity generally increases with the volume fraction of mobile phase.  
 
Figure 1: Conductivity (mS cm-1) of Nafion at room temperature equilibrat ed with water (bl ack squares),  alcohols 
(methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol; teal triangles, orange  circles, and purple diamonds, respectively) , and octane  
(yellow hexagrams ) from vapor phase. Conductivity scaled not only with sorbate  volume fraction but with polarity  
and molar volume of so rbate .  
 The decreasing conductivity of Nafion with increased sorbate volume fraction could be attributed 
to the interplay of the mobility and concentration of proton s in each of these sorbates, as well as distinct 
changes in the ionomer morphology  when swollen with alcohols rather than  water. In gener al, hydrated 
Nafion exhibits a morphology characterized by locally flat and highly branched water -rich domains 
embedded in a fluoropolymer matrix5,30–33. This morpho logy has been widely studied by small -angle X-ray 
scattering  (SAXS) which reveals a broad scattering peak attributed to water -rich domains around scattering 
vector q of 0.15 Å -1 or domain spacing ( dspace = 2𝜋/q) between 3 and 6 nm34–40. Figure 2  shows Nafion ’s SAXS profiles under dry environments and  equilibrated with liquid water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, 
hexane, heptane, and octane. Alkanes induced minimal  change in the scattering profiles, consistent with 
their negligible bulk uptake. Alcohol -swollen Nafion, however, exhibited significant changes in the 
scattering behavior; the ionomer peak shifted to lower q values relative to the dry material, indicating 
ionomer domain swelling, but with broader peaks th an water -swollen Nafion . There wa s also a clear shift 
to larger q (smaller dspace) with increasing alcohol size. While a lkane -saturated Nafion showed similar dspace 
and full-width at half maximum  (FWHM ) to the dry material , these features scaled with sorbate polarity  in 
the case  of alcohol -saturated Nafion; increasing polarity coincide d with increased  dspace  and lower FWHM  
(see F igure S 4 in the supporting information). Less polar alcohols appear ed to result in  smaller ionomer 
nano -domains within a network of increasing  spatial  disorder, contributing to the reduction in ionic 
conductivity despite high alcohol volume fraction. It is also important to note that the matrix knee ( q ~ 0.05 
Å-1), arising from the ordered distribution of PTFE crystallites  within the fluoropolymer matri x, is absent 
in the alcohol -swollen Nafion (Figure 2). Alcohols , while interacting more preferably with the 
fluoropolymer matrix compared to water , are still not able to dissolve PTFE crystal lites, so this loss of 
scattering is likely  due to redistribution  (i.e., increasing isotropy) of crystallites within the ionomer ’s 
amorphous matrix , which is consistent with observations in acetone -swollen Nafion22, and with matrix 
plasticization observed in methanol -swollen Nafion29. 
 
Figure 2: (a) SAXS profiles of Nafion 117 dry and equilibrated with various liquid sorbates. Alkanes induced little 
change in the scattering profiles, consistent with their minimal mass uptake. Alcohols induced a strong shift in the 
ionomer peak to lower scattering vectors while increasing its breadth and decreasing its intensity relative to water -
equilibrated Nafion.  
Changes in nanostructure morphology  are also clear  when  comparing the ionomer nano -domain 
swelling ( dsaturated  / ddry) to bulk swelling  for the different species  (Figure 3a). In water -swollen Nafion, there 
is a well -established correlation between nanoswel ling and water  volume fraction :  
 𝑑
𝑑𝑑𝑟𝑦=(1−𝜙𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 )−𝑚= (𝜙𝑝)−𝑚 (Equation 1) 
where 𝑚 is a constant  that indicates the shape/morphology of ionomer domains2,19. For Nafion swollen with  
water  (𝜙𝑝>0.5), 𝑚 is slightly greater than 1  indicating a locally  lamellar domain structure with mesoscale 
connectivity, while in dispersion  (𝜙𝑝<0.5),  𝑚 approaches 0.5 reflecting cylindrical polymer 
aggregates30,34,41,42. Figure 3a shows that organic sorbates  deviate d significantly from water -Nafion 
behavior  with nanoswelling related to sorbate polarity.  Alkanes induced almost no nanoswelling  in Nafion , 
confirming  limited penetration of nonpolar sorbates into ionomer domains. Alcohols did cause substantial 
nanoswelling  in Nafion with magnitude  decreas ing mono tonically with increasing sorbate volume fraction 
(i.e., methanol > ethanol > isopropanol). This indicates that the distribution of sorbate within the ionomer 
structure  is impact ed by sorbate chemical identity, as  in the absence of structural changes the n anoswelling 
would scale identically with sorbate volume fraction  regardless of the sorbate identity . Figure 3b shows the 
morphological exponent  m was strongly correlated to sorbate polarity (represented as dielectric constant)  
and shifted towards lower val ues ( indicating loss of lamellar structure and transition towards dispersion -
like scaling) with decreasing polarity . It should be noted the 𝑚 values reported here are based only on dry 
and sorbate -saturated  Nafion. W ithout intermediate swelling fractions , the relationship  in Equation 1  cannot 
be precisely determined . Still, the trend clearly shows a correlation between solvent polarity and the 
relationship between bulk and nano -domain swelling  through morphological rearrangements .  
Figure 3: (a) Nanoswelling/ macroscopic  swelling relationships for Nafion swollen with organic species deviated 
significantly from water -swollen Nafion. (b) T he nanoscal e morphology factor  m increased monotonically with 
solvent dielectric constant.  
These changes likely a rise from the affinity  of the sorbate for different moieties in the polymer ; 
highly polar water molecules ( 𝜖 ~ 80) strongly solvate sulfonic acid moieties but display minimal affinity 
for perfluoroether side chains , resulting in strong phase separation an d a relatively sharp 
fluoropolymer/water interface . Alcohols  and acetone  have been shown to  interact  with the perfluoroether 
side chains , partition across the water -fluoropolymer interface , and impact the fluoropolymer 
matrix21,22,29,43,44. Increased mixing of sorbate and fluoropolymer  would have  the following impacts on 
ionomer domain structure and conductivity: ( i) reduced phase separation and redistribution of sorbate across 
the liquid/fluoropolymer interface , (ii) significant changes in the shape and ordering of ionomer domains 
accompanied by disr uption of the domain -network , and  (iii) increased penetration of fluoropolymer into 
swollen ionomer channels . Together, these effects would result in  increased network tortuosity (per 
structural changes), increas ed local  viscosit y within ionomer channels,  and decreas ed H+ mobility despite 
higher fraction of the mobile phase.  
 
Figure 4: Overview of the proposed  impacts of sorbate polarity on ionomer structure and transport. Water 
strongly solvates protons and sulfonic acid groups while displaying minimal affinity for perfluoroether side chains or 
fluoropolymer backbone. This produces a sharp fluoropolymer/ionome r interface with a high concentration of mobile 
protons. Alcohols of increasing size (decreasing polarity) increasingly mix with perfluoroether side chains, softening 
the fluoropolymer/sorbate interface and decreasing proton mobility due in part to increas es in local viscosity. Alkanes 
display  minimal affinity for ionic groups and fluoropolymer and do not significantly alter Nafion from its dry state.  
 While studying the properties of PFSAs in pure sorbate environments is useful in characterizing 
sorbate/io nomer interactions, organic electrochemical devices commonly  employ water as a solvent and/or 
to maintain membrane hydration45, and thus it  is important to understand of how organic species interact 
with PFSAs in the presence of water.   
The limited uptake of alkanes by Nafion in pure-sorbate studies suggests a  mixture of alkane and 
water vapor will likely lead to  similar n ano-swelling and ionic conductivity to pure water , while  
alcohol/water mixtures may exhibit more complex  behavior. At a given water saturation, adding  alcohol 
vapor may add mechanical resistance to hydration by  further deforming the  fluoropolymer matrix, shifting  
the equilibrium toward lower water concentration. However, t hese mechanical considerations are 
complicated  by the possible alcohol -induced matrix  plasticiz ation  and change in domain network 
morphology . To assess these competing effects, Nafion was  exposed to controlled mixtures of water and 
organic vapor. In these experiments, a water -saturated stream was balanced by an organic vapor -saturated 
stream.  Figure 5(a) shows impact of  introduction of organic vapors  at a given water saturation  on Nafion’s  
conductivity . As expected, alkanes did not significantly impact the water uptake or ionic conductivity of 
water -swollen Nafion since their penetration was negligible.  Alcohols induced  large polarity -related differenc es in  Nafion  ionic conductivity at low  water 
content which  became increasingly small as water content in creased , approaching the water -saturated ionic 
conductivity . At low water content, the presence of alcohols increased  Nafion ’s ionic conductivity due to 
the inherent conductivity of alcohol -swollen Nafion,  but this improvement was lost at intermediate and high 
water  saturation. Alcohol -driven loss of conductivity  at intermediate water content  scaled sim ilarly to pure 
sorbate systems ( 𝜅water ~ 𝜅Water+MeOH  > 𝜅 Water+EtOH  > 𝜅 Water+iPrOH ) which suggests appreciable uptake of these 
alcohols in addition to water. Figure 5b shows ionic conductivity of Nafion swollen with organic vapor 
alone (empty markers) and organic vapor balanced with water vapor (f illed markers). It is clear that  at 
intermediate alcohol /water saturation, the conductivity generally fell between that of the pure sorbates 
(water and alcohol)  suggesting both species are absorbed and contribute to the ionic conductivity.  In these 
environ ments, ion conduction is governed by the same physical considerations as in single -sorbate 
environments ( i.e., the shape  and tortuosity of ionomer domains and the mobility and concentration of 
protons within those domains) . Similar observations were recent ly reported for cation -exchanged PFSI; 
Cerium doping was shown to impact ionomer conductivity by reducing proton concentration and mobility 
as well as increasing tortuosity of the overall domain structure46. Mixed ionomer -sorbate systems may 
exhibit  additional  complexity due to the unknown composition of the sorbate mixture  inside the ionomer 
domains .  
 
Figure 5: (a) Ionic conductivity of Nafion swollen with water alone (bl ack squares) and  with various organ ic species. 
While nonpolar alkanes had minimal impact on the ionic conductivity, alcohols imparted high conductivity at low 
water saturation (high organic saturation)  but approached the conductivity of water -swollen Nafion at higher water 
saturation  (low organic saturation) . (b) Ionic conductivity of Nafion swollen with organics alone (empty markers) and 
organic vapor balanced with water vapor (filled markers). Ionic conductivity of alcohol - and water - swollen Nafion 
was generally between that of the pure s orbate cases, indicated uptake and influence of both species on the ionomer 
conductivity.  
Sorbate mixture composition was quantitatively determined by ATR -FTIR using a linear regression 
trained with water -saturated and organic -saturated Nafion FTIR spectra  to determine the relative 
contributions of each  sorbate . Figure 6 shows sorbate uptake isotherms of alcohol in Nafion in mixed - and 
single - sorbate environments , with consistently higher alcohol uptake in Nafion with the presence of water . 
This complement ary behavior points to differences in how the chemical species interact with and swell 
Nafion;  swelling in Nafion at a given water activity is generally constrained by the fluoropolymer resistance 
to mechanical deformation.  As observed in pure -sorbate envi ronments, a lcohols may interact with the 
perfluoroether chains and soften the water/fluoropolymer interface  while  reducing the matrix stress and 
allowing for higher total sorbate uptake than in a single -sorbate environment at the same chemical activity. 
Alcohols can benefit from this by mixing with water in the ionomer regions and by partitioning across the 
water/fluoropolymer interface . This would result in increased total swelling and possibly a non -uniform 
distribution of alcohol and water within the ion omer domain structure. This possible distribution of sorbates 
is also consistent with ionic conductivity results for mixed -sorbate Nafion which show conductivity higher 
than alcohol alone as water contributes to a higher proton mobility  and produces more s trongly phase -
separated ionomer domains . On the other hand, mixed -sorbate -swollen Nafion conductivity was  lower than 
water -swollen Nafion  as alcohols in the ionomer domains increase local viscosity and their partitioning 
across the water/fluoropolymer inte rface would alter the domain structure and increase side chain 
penetration into the water -rich domains.   
Figure 6: Molar uptake of organic sorbates with water (filled markers , solid lines ) and without water (empty markers , 
dashed lines ) determined by regression of ATR -FTIR spectra . Overall, mixed -sorbate systems with alcohol exhibited 
higher molar uptake than single -sorbate systems, with much of the increase attributed to additional alcohol uptak e.  
The impacts of mixed -sorbate environme nts on Nafion’s phase -separated nanomorp hology were 
investigated by SAXS of Nafion equilibrated with mixed vapor saturated with water and an organic species.  
SAXS profiles are shown in Figure 7 and reveal a well -defined ionomer peak with alkane/water mixtures 
closely resembling the spectra of water -equilibrated Nafion. Negligible uptake of alkanes resulted in similar 
Nafion nanostructure, swelling, and conductivity to Nafion with water alone . Alcohol/water mixtures show 
an ionomer pea k shifted to lower scattering vector q (larger domain spacing) than water alone and with 
greater intensity/sharpness than alcohol alone. Increased total sorbate uptake for mixed sorbate systems is 
expected to produce larger domain spacing, so this does not  necessarily indicate a change in the way 
water/alcohol are partitioned  as was observed in the pure sorbates (i.e., no change in m can be resolved). 
However, the matrix knee is notably absent from isopropanol/water - and ethanol/water Nafion, suggesting 
the role of the alcohol in altering  the distribution of cry stallites in pure solv ents persists in the presence of 
water.  SAXS p rofiles  suggest that  mixed water -alcohol environment s preserve the overall domain structure 
of water -swollen Nafion but with larger interdomain spacing enabled by  matrix plasticization , disruption 
of inter -crystalline order,  and/or distribution  of alcohol across the water/fluoropolymer interface . Water 
appea rs to play a critical role in ionomer network  formation , confirming  the orders -of-magnitude increase 
in Nafion ionic conductivity at a given organic saturation upon introduction of water (Figure 5b).  
 
Figure 7: SAXS profiles of Nafion  equilibrated with s aturated water vapor and saturated methanol ( teal triangles ), 
ethanol (orange circles ), isopropanol ( purple  diamonds ), hexane ( pink right arrows ), heptane ( green  left arrows), and 
octane ( yellow hexagrams ). Profiles of Nafion dry (dashed line) and equilibrated with water vapor only (solid line) 
are included for reference.  
Conclusions  
The findings presented here show that  the well -established hydration -structure -property 
relationships are fundamentally different in Nafion when swollen with organic so rbates. In organic -swollen 
Nafion , the sorbate polarity plays a key role in determining the bulk swelling and ionomer domain structure 
likely based on the solvation tendencies of the sorbate towards the fluoropolymer. In general, more polar 
solvents produc ed larger ionomer domains at lower sorbate content and yielded a higher conductivity 
ionomer. In the presence of water and organic species, water play s a crucial role in the ionomer network 
formation while alcohols may aid bulk and ionomer -domain swelling by penetrating across the 
fluoropolymer/water interface.  Alkanes showed almost no sorption and therefore minimal impact on ionic 
conductivity or domain structure regardless of the water content. These results point to  fundamental 
physical relationships bet ween sorbate polarity, ionomer nanostructure,  and key ionomer performance 
metrics  which may limit the applicability of PFSAs for electrochemical systems employing alcohols and 
other polar organic species , while also providing guidance for design of differe nt ionomer -solvent systems 
for applications  involving electro -organic reactions . 
Materials  
Nafion 117 and Nafion D2021 were purchased from The Fuel Cell Store (College Station, TX). All 
other chemicals were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich , Inc. (St. Louis, MO).  
Experimental  
Concise experimental information is included here.  A full expanded description of all experimental 
procedures and calculations can be found in the supporting information.  
For ionic conductivity and sorbate uptake experiments, sorbate satu ration was controlled by mixing  
dry and sorbate -saturated nitrogen streams at controlled flow rates. The sorbate -saturated stream was 
generated by flowing nitrogen through a midget impinger bubbler (Ace Glass) filled with the species of 
interest. The sorba te saturation  𝑠𝐴 can be approximated as :  
 𝑠𝐴=𝑣𝑎̇
𝑣𝑎̇+ 𝑣̇0 (Equation 1)  
where 𝑣𝑎̇ and 𝑣̇0 are the flow rate s of sorbate -saturated and dry nitrogen, respectively. The total flow rate 
was maintained at 200 sccm.  For mixed sorbate (i.e., organic and water) experiments, the nitrogen stream 
was replaced with a water -saturated stream and saturation of each species was determined as described 
above, assuming no interaction between sorbates in the vapor phase.  
Sorbate  Uptake  
ATR -FTIR spectra  were collected with a Nicolet 6700 FTIR from Thermo Scientific with Smart 
iTR attachment and ZnSe single -pass crystal (Thermo Electron North America, West Palm Beach, FL) as 
the average of 50 spectra collected from 650 – 4000 cm-1. After background collec tion under nitrogen flow, 
Nafion films were drop -cast on the crystal from Nafion 2021 to produce a film with thickness > 200 μm, 
much greater than the expected light penetration depth into Nafion (on the order of 1 μm, dependent on the 
light wavelength and  Nafion refractive index). After drying films at ambient conditions for 30 min and 
under vacuum for 2 hours, residual alcohol was detected in the ATR -FTIR spectra that persisted under vacuum and/or nitrogen flow. This residual alcohol was fully removed by rehydrating the films with 
deionized water for 20 min and then drying again under vacuum. After the final drying step, the ATR crystal 
was loaded into the FTIR in a custom -built PTFE cell with flow inlet and outlet.  At each saturation setpoint, 
ATR -FTIR sp ectra were collected periodically until the difference in absorption at a given wavenumber 
deviated by less than 1% over a 30 -minute interval.  Plotted points represent final measured values.  
Sorbate uptake at intermediate (between 0 and 1) vapor saturation  was estimated by linear 
regression of the as -saturated Nafion ATR -FTIR spectrum to the dry and fully saturated spectra. Relative 
uptake of sorbate A ( 𝑋𝐴) was defined as the dependent variable and the measured absorbance at each 
wavenumber 𝐴𝑗, where su bscript 𝑗 is the index for each  wavenumber,  as the independent variable. 12,238 
wavenumbers  were evaluated in the range 3600 to 650 cm-1. Relative sorbate uptake 𝑋𝐴 was defined as  
 
𝑋𝐴=𝑎+∑ 𝑏𝑗𝐴𝑗12238
𝑗=1 (Equation 2)  
where 𝑏𝑗 is a weighted fitting parameter describing the sensitivity of 𝐴𝑗 to sorbate A saturation at the 𝑗𝑡ℎ 
wavenumber, and 𝑎 is an additional fitting parameter . Mass fraction of sorbate i n the ionomer was 
calculated as  
 𝑚𝐴=𝑋𝐴(∆𝑀
𝑀𝑑𝑟𝑦+∆𝑀) (Equation 3) 
where 𝑚𝐴 is the mass fraction of species A and 𝑀𝑑𝑟𝑦 and ∆𝑀 are the initial (dry) mass and mass uptake of 
sorbate, respectively, determined by gravimetric dynamic vapor sorption.  This method offers several key 
advantages over traditional absorbance -based analys is techniques  (i.e. Beer’ s Law at a fixed wavenumber 
or linear combination of the absorbance spectra of individual components) as it  (i) accounts for changes in 
Nafion and s orbate spectra upon mixing ( ii) uses the entire absorbance range and (iii) enables simple 
analysis of multi -sorbate mixtures . In cases with multiple sorbates, a multi -target linear regression was 
performed using the spectra of dry Nafion and Nafion saturat ed with each sorbate.  Relative uptake 𝑋𝑖 of 
each sorbate was estimated as   
𝑋𝑖=𝑎𝑖+∑ 𝑏𝑖𝑗𝐴𝑗12238
𝑗=1 (Equation 4)  
where subscript 𝑖 denotes the sorbate. The linear regression was performed using  Scikit -learn in Python47. 
Demonstration of ATR -FTIR and regression results for methanol -equilibrated Nafion can be found in the 
supporting information.  
Ionic Conductivity  
Nafion ionic conductivity was measured using a BT -110 four probe in -plane membrane 
conductivity clamp (Scribner Associates, Inc., Southern Pines, NC). A strip of Nafion 117 was cut to a 
width ~ 1 cm and long enough to completely cover two platinum -gauze force leads (2.5 cm). Membrane 
width was measured from photographs of the membrane in ImageJ by le ngth-calibrated pixel count, with 
at least 20 measurements per membrane. Dry thickness of Nafion 117 is reported as 183 μm and was verified 
by micrometer measurement prior to affixing in the conductivity clamp. The conductivity clamp was placed 
in a vented  environmental chamber with flow inlet.  
Sorbate saturation  was incremented  from 0 to 1 in steps of 0.125. The membrane was equilibrated 
at each step for 2 hours or until the difference in cond uctivity values deviated by less than 0.1% over a 10 -
min interva l. Mixed -sorbate experiments were started at full organic saturation (water saturation of 0) and 
the organic saturation was decremented as the water saturation was incremented.   
Conductivity was determined by linear -sweep voltammetry from -0.1 to 0.1 V at a sweep rate of 
20 mV s-1. Cell resistance R was determined from the slope of the LSV trace and conductivity was calculated 
as 
 𝜅=𝐿
𝑅𝑤𝑡 (Equation 5) Where L is the distance between the counter - and working - sense leads, R is the cell resistance, and w and 
t are the width and thickness of the dry membrane scaled by the linear swelling 𝜀 at the given saturation 
step 
 𝜀=𝑠𝐴(1+ ∆𝑉
𝑉𝑑𝑟𝑦)1
3 (Equation 6) 
where ∆𝑉
𝑉𝑑𝑟𝑦 is the volumetric expansion of Nafion 117 saturated with sorbate A as determined  by ATR -
FTIR regression at the same saturati on. Conductivity was measured every 10 minutes during vapor 
equilibration until the deviation between measurements was less than 0.1%.  
Small Angle X -Ray Scattering  
SAXS measurements were performed at beamline 7.3 .3 of the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence 
Berkeley National Lab. The X -ray energy was 10 keV with a monochromator resolution E/dE of 100. 
Scattering patterns were acquired with a 2D Dectris Pilatus 1M CCD area detector (172 µm x 172 µm pixel 
size).  The scattering wave vector, 𝑞=4𝜋sin(𝜃
2)/𝜆, where θ is the scattering angle, was in the range of 
0.004 to 0. 4 Å-1. Experiments were conducted in-situ by equilibrating  the membrane samples in liquid or 
in vapor using custom -designed sealed sample holders w ith X -ray transparent KaptonTM windows for 
imaging. For liquid -equilibrated experiments, circular membrane samples were completely immersed in 
the holder filled with liquid (water or alcohol). Vapor -equilibr ation  of the sample s was accomplished using 
seale d holders containing a controlled mixture of water and solvent in the solution reservoir.  For each 
equilibrium method, samples were equilibrated for at least 2 hours and SAXS images for vapor - and liquid -
equilibrated samples were collected in-situ with an exposur e time of 20 seconds. The collected two -
dimensional scattering patterns were azimuthally integrated to generate 1 -D intensity profiles, I(q), which
