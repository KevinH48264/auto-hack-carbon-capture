Abstract  
 Developing improved methods for CO 2 capture and concentration (CCC) is essential to 
mitigating the impact of our current emissions and can lead to carbon net negative technologies. 
Electrochemical approaches for CCC c an achieve much higher theoretical efficiencies 
compared to the thermal methods that have been more commonly pursued. The use of redox 
carriers , or molecular species  that can bind and release CO 2 depending on their  oxidation state, 
is an increasingly popular approach as carrier  properties can be tailored for different 
applications. They key requirements for stable and efficient redox carriers are discussed in the 
context of chemical scaling relationships  and operati onal conditions . Computational and 
experimental approaches towards developing redox carriers with optimized  properties is also 
described.  
1.  Introduction  
1.1  Background  
Carbon dioxide ( CO 2) capture and concentration (CCC) is a foundational  technology  which, 
in concert with low -carbon power production, enhanced transmission and distribution, and 
efficient use, can enable transition to a sustainable global energy economy. The deployment of 
CCC coupled with sequestration or utilization can immediately address greenhouse gas 
emissions .1–3 In the current energy and industrial sectors, post -combustion or post -process capture 
can be used to remove CO 2 from large volume point sources (i.e., flue gases or effluent gases) 
following fossil -fuel combustion or chemical transformations  in hard-to-decarbonize sectors (e.g., 
steel and cement industries) .4,5 Other sectors lead to a large quantity of disperse, small volume CO 2 emission streams (e.g., transportation, residential, and agricultural) that can also be mobile, and 
thus challenges the use of point source capture approaches. In such cases, direct air capture (DAC), 
where CO 2 is separated from ambient air, may be the be st method for carbon emissions 
management. Operation  of DAC in the long -term can also lead to net -negative operation.6,7 At 
present, a number of global CCC projects are operational, under development, or in construction, 
for both post -combustion capture and DAC.8 While candidate CCC technologies have been 
demonstrated at relevant scales, widespread implementation is largely limited by technical and 
economic factors.  The most significant barrier  is the high energetic requirements  of current  
systems, which in turn leads to high capital and operating costs.5,6,9 –11 Ultimately, the mechanism 
of CO 2 capture and release will define system energetics and overall process c osts. 
The most common approaches for both post -combustion capture and DAC employ thermally -
driven chemical absorption (adsorption) cycles, where a solvent (sorbent) is used to bind CO 2, 
effectively removing it from a feed gas stream, followed by an input of heat as the primary driving 
force for solvent (sorbent) regeneration and CO 2 recovery at higher concentrations 5,6 The key 
challenge in using heat for CO 2 capture and release is that the two components of free energy, 
enthalpy and entropy, make opposin g contributions in each step. CO 2 capture is entropically 
unfavorable ; therefore , capture of dilute CO 2 requires sufficiently large negative sorbent reaction 
enthalpies  (i.e., large binding affinities) . However, the large reaction enthalpies required for 
capture hamper  CO 2 release. Since release is entropically favorable, elevated  temperatures  are 
required to offset the large negative enthalpic contribution . As such, temperature -driven CO 2 
absorption or adsorption systems  have high heating demands during regeneration , particularly 
from dilute feed streams such as air. Current processes operate with low energetic efficiencies of 
ca. 5 -30%, even after optimization  at scale.12–16 These lower energetic efficienc ies limit the 
potential for cost reduction in thermochemical CO 2 capture systems.   
Although less mature, the use of electrochemical CCC (eCCC) cycles to separate CO 2 has the 
potential to address the inherent limitations of thermochemically -based absorption or adsorption 
processes. Use of electrochemistry can enable high energetic efficiencies, safe operation at mild 
conditions (closer to ambient temperature and pressure), and direct coupling with renewable 
energy sources. Electrochemical technologies are also modular, and thus can be scaled down more 
readily than thermochemical processes, which may permit cost -effective capture from 
small/ disperse emissions.17–21  A variety of electrochemical methods for CO 2 capture have been pursued , starting in the  late 
1960’s,22 where the use of molten salt electrolysis was proposed to maintain CO 2 levels in sealed 
close -quarter vessels such as submarines, aircraft , or spacecraft.23–27 The cost of electricity (as 
compared to heat) likely limited large scale technology deployment and restricted  use to niche 
applications where efficiency and compactness superseded cost.   
Recently, t here has been renewed interest in employing electrochemical approaches for carbon 
capture, and broadly across industry, due to (1) the increasing urgency to meaningful ly address 
CO 2 emission s to avoid the worst effects of climate change and (2) the emergence and expansion 
of low -cost carbon -free renewable electricity enabled by increasing deployments of solar and wind 
technologies.  As a result, this field has expanded t o include MOFs,28–31 electrochemically mediated 
amine regeneration (EMAR),32–37 as well as the utilization of bipolar membranes38 or proton 
couple d electron transfer (PCET) mediators39–45 which induce pH changes in aqueous solutions to 
facilitate CO 2 uptake and release . In addition to these methods, there has been increasing interest 
in the  utilization of redox -active capture molecules to directly bind and release CO 2, which is the 
focus of this tutorial review. In these direct eCCC systems, redox -active sorbents can be 
solubilized (dissolved in an electrolyte) or immobilized (embedded on an electrode surface). While 
there are similarities between design considerations for both approaches, here we specifically 
consider the case of solubilized sorbents, which can also be referred to as redox carriers. For these 
systems, the design of redox carriers with desirable properties is essential for d eveloping cost -
competitive and long -lasting technologies with high energetic efficiency, CO 2 selectivity, 
separation capacity, and sorbent stability. To this end, this tutorial review seeks to describe the 
basics of eCCC systems, outline design criteria fo r redox carriers and system requirements , survey 
redox carrier molecules and observed trends,  and highlight opportunities for scientific and 
engineering advancement through the lens of molecular design.  
 
1.2 Thermodynamic Considerations for eCCC Processes  
For any CCC approach, t he minimum thermodynamic work required to concentrate CO 2 from 
an ideal  gaseous mixture i s governed by the standard Gibb s free energy  difference,  Δ𝐺min (J mol-
1 CO 2), for a specific shift in equilibrium. For removing an in finitesimal quantity of CO 2, such that 
the bulk composition remains unaltered, this thermodynamic limit is given by the following 
equation.46 Δ𝐺min =𝑅𝑇ln(𝑄CO2)    where   𝑄CO2=𝑃CO2,f
𝑃CO2,i                                        1 
Here, R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J mol-1 K-1), T is the absolute temperature (K), and 
QCO2 is the reaction quotient ( -) for the CO 2 concentration process. The partial pressures of CO 2 in 
the initial and final mixtures are denoted by 𝑃CO2,i and 𝑃CO2,f. This relationship between the change 
in free energy and reaction equilibria in equation 1 in dicates that the process of concentrating CO 2 
is endergonic and is dependent upon the desired changes in concentration and system temperature. 
For context, Table 1 shows the minimum work required to concentrate CO 2 into a pure stream 
(100% CO 2 or 𝑃CO2,f = 1 atm) at standard temperature ( 𝑇 = 298 K) fro m a variety of application -
relevant initial concentrations ( 𝑃CO2,i). The data from Table 1 shows that  more energy  is needed  to 
concentrate  CO 2 from more dilute sources; for instance, it requires more than 4× the energy to 
capture CO 2 from the atmosphere (0.04% CO 2)47 as compared to flue gas from a coal -fired power 
plant (15% CO 2)47, with 19.4 and 4.7 kJ mol-1 CO 2 required, respectively. The minimum energy 
requi rements also increase as  the fraction of CO 2 captured deviates from 0 and more than an 
infinitesimal quantity of CO 2 is removed. For example, when 90% of CO 2 is captured from flue 
gas (15% CO 2), Δ𝐺min increases to 6.4 kJ mol-1 CO 2 (calculated using equations derived by 
Lackner ).46 
For electrochemically -mediated processes, the capture and release cycles are initiated by 
applying a potential or bias to an electrode  inste ad of the changes in temperature that are used in 
thermally -driven systems. The electrochemical bias at the electrode surface results in oxidation or 
reduction of species in solution that captures or releases  CO 2 in the solution or material surface(s) 
to carr y out the CCC process. The change in the Gibb s free energy , ∆𝐺 (J mol-1), for an 
electrochemical process is thus related to the cell potential, 𝐸cell (V) and computed Δ𝐺min and 
𝐸min requirements for the as sociated  eCCC processes , as described in Table 1 . It is assumed that 
CO 2 is recovered at 100% purity ( 𝑃CO2,f = 1 atm ) and the redox carrier can theoretically capture 
one CO 2 molecule for every electron transferred ( 𝑛𝑞⁄=1).

While 𝐸min is relatively low, this represents the minimum potential required for separation,  
and the actual cell voltage  will be larger due to concentration changes during operation and cell 
overpotentials, as described in Section 1.5. The extent of the deviation in the cell voltage from 
𝐸min will be dictated by properties of the sorbent chemistry as well as process  design  aspects . 
Thus, for direct eCCC systems, redox carrier design and process engineering will be important to 
achieve optimal properties for efficient separations.  
 
1.3 Overview of eCCC with Redox Carrier s 
A redox carrier for CO 2 must be able to reversibly bind CO 2 in one oxidation state and release 
it in another as shown in Scheme 1. Typically, the resting state carrier ( R) is reduced with 𝑛 
electrons to form the active state carrier species ( R)𝑛− at a reduction  potential (i.e., standard 
reduction potential), 𝐸1/2(cap ). The reduced species has a high affinity for CO 2 (𝐾CO2(R𝑛−)), and 
can bind 𝑞 CO 2 molecules, which allows capture from a dilute inlet stream to form the CO 2-bound 
adduct, R(CO 2)𝑞𝑛−. CO 2 release is t riggered by oxidation of R(CO 2)𝑞𝑛− to form R(CO 2)𝑞, which 
is characterized by 𝐸1/2(rel). The oxidized carrier has a much lower affinity for CO 2 (𝐾CO2(R)), 
resulting in liberation of 𝑞 CO 2 to reform the resting -state carrier ( R) and complete the cycle. This 
approach takes advantage of the difference between the CO 2 binding affinities  of the oxidized, 
𝐾CO2(R), and reduced, 𝐾CO2(R𝑛−), states of the carrier ( R and R𝑛−, respectively). While we 
specifically discuss systems that employ solubilized redox carriers, Scheme 1 is also 
representative of eCCC with immobilized, redox -active sorbents. We also note that the reaction mechanism shown in Scheme 1 is simplified ; in rea lity, carriers may undergo multiple electron 
transfer events and bind CO 2 at each associated oxidation state , which  is discussed in more detail 
in Section 2.1.  
 
Scheme 1. General process for eCCC systems featuring a redox carrier ( R, top left). (R), which 
has a small or negligible binding constant for CO 2 (KCO2(R) ), is reduced at the cathode at E1/2(cap) 
potential to yield (R)n‒, which has a higher binding constant for CO 2 (KCO2(Rn –)). The reduced 
carrier (R)n‒ selectively binds CO 2 from a dilute gas stream, forming R(CO 2)qn‒. Regeneration of 
the carrier is accomplished by oxidation of R(CO 2)qn‒ to R(CO 2)q at the anode at E1/2(rel) leading 
to release and concentration of CO 2 and regeneration of the neutral state of the redox agent (R). 
In this scheme, 𝑛 represents the stoichiometric ratio of moles of electrons transferred per mole of 
CO 2. (Right, in red) Two reactions with O 2 and H 2O that can deactivate (R)n‒: 1) If the  E°cathodic  
potential is more negative than the O 2/O2•‒ reduction potential, electron transfer from (R)n- to O 2 
to form superoxide can occur. 2) If the p KA of (RH)(n-1) is higher than the p KA of water or protic 
solvent, protonation of (R)n‒ can occur.  
 
1.4 System Configurations for eCCC with Redox Carrier s 
While dominant process designs have yet to emerge due to the relative nascency of the field, 
multiple groups have considered different design strategies for electrochemical CO 2 
separators,32,39,51,52 which can be broadly categorized into four system configurations. Figure 1 
presents envisioned examples of each configuration for continuous eCCC systems based on 
solubilized redox carriers. A 4 -stage system (Figure 1(a)) employs an electrochemical cell for 
carrier activation (cathode) and deactivation (anode). CO 2 dissolution  and absorption, following 
carrier activation, primarily occurs in a separate process unit su ch as an absorption column.  
Similarly, CO 2 desorption and degasification are carried out in a separate process step after 
deactivation. A mode for CO 2 removal can be incorporated into the anode design, which is referred 
to as anodic desorption. This allows for simultaneous carrier deactivation, CO 2 desorption, and 
degasification , which eliminat es the need for a separate desorption unit. Adoption of anod ic 
desorption in the system is classified as a 3 -stage configuration (Figure 1(b)). A 3 -stage 
configuration can instead incorporate cathodic absorption (Figure 1(c)), where the CO 2-containing 
feed gas is contacted with the carrier within the cathode compar tment. This cathode design allows 
for simultaneous carrier activation, CO 2 dissolution, and CO 2 absorption. Finally, a 2 -stage 
configuration integrates both anodic desorption and cathodic absorption, such that all phenomena 
occur within the electrochemical  cell (Figure 1(d)). This type of system could potentially be 
operated without the need for liquid pumping. In this format, the carrier -containing electrolyte can 
be enclosed within the inter -electrode gap, either as a free liquid volume, imbibed into a po rous 
separator, or absorbed into a membrane. Notably, a 2 -stage configuration has also been 
demonstrated with immobilized redox -active sorbents  on a working electrode, paired with a 
counter electrode that serves as a source and sink of electrons.53,54  This cell format necessitates 
batch (i.e., electro -swing55), rather than continuous operation, where the working electrode is 
cycled between the CO 2 capture and release stages.  
Prior work has demonstrated that each of the considered configurations can lead to significant 
differences in performance. Thermodynamic mo deling shows that 2 -stage systems can operate at 
the highest energetic efficiency and approach the thermodynamic limit for energy requirements 
(Δ𝐺min). More generally, implementation of cathodic absorption and/or anodic desorption reduce s 
the thermodynami c driving force for capture and release, leading to greater reversibility and  
resulting in higher energetic efficiencies.52,56 However, system design decisions should not be 
based on this thermodynamic argument alone. For example, operation of a system with a reduced 
driving force for binding and/or release will occur at a slower rate. In  a system with cathodic 
absorption, this will manifest as current density limitations, as operation of the electrochemical 
cell will likely be restricted by mass transport of CO 2 from the feed gas to the reaction environment. 
Thus, it is likely that operat ing current densities for configurations with cathodic absorption will be lower, especially for capturing CO 2 from dilute sources, leading to higher electrochemical 
reactor costs. There are other aspects to consider as well which may not be specifically li nked to 
performance. For example, a 4 -stage system makes use of process units that are commonly 
employed and well understood in industry (i.e. absorption columns and flash tanks), and therefore 
implementation of this configuration may be beneficial for pos t-combustion capture from 
industrial sources and power plants. Comparatively, a 2 -stage system can embody a more 
simplified and modular process scheme with no liquid circulation. This may be advantageous for 
DAC applications which do not have requirements for process size and may be operated in remote 
locations. Overall, four general configurations have been considered thus far, which will each have 
inherent advantages and disadvantages, and thus each may be more beneficial in different 
applications. While choice of configuration in itself can impact performance, this is also innately 
linked with molecular properties. More generally, molecular properties impact process 
performance, and the resulting  trends are different for each configuration , which is  described in 
more detail in the following section.

1.5 General Requirements for eCCC with Redox Carriers  
For redox carriers, there are general criteria which can enable high performance eCCC 
systems if achieved. The ideal redox carrier should have high affinity for CO 2 binding when 
activated, complete CO 2 release when deactivated, high solubility, high CO 2 selectivity , and long -
term stability. Th ese characteristics will enable sorbents with long lifetimes and high CO 2 
separation capacities, reducing the required cost of materials and chemicals. Additionally, the 
ideal carrier and electrolyte pair should permit fast mass transport and kinetics, ope ration at low 
cell voltages, and high current densities. Such conditions will minimize costs associated with both 
energy and materials.  
High CO 2 binding affinity and complete release is important for achieving high separation 
capacities due to the impact o n faradaic efficiency (defined here as moles of CO 2 separated per 
mole of electron s transferred). Achievement of these properties will be dictated by binding 
constants in the activated and deactivated states 𝐾CO2(R𝑛−) and 𝐾CO2(R), respectively, for the 
simplified mechanism in Scheme 1. Specifically, 𝐾CO2(R𝑛−) must be high enough to captur e CO 2 
from a given feed gas composition and  𝐾CO2(R) must be low enough to permit the complete 
release of CO 2. For example, previous work has estimated that CO 2 capture at high faradaic 
efficiencies from flue gas (15% CO 2) requires 𝐾CO2(R𝑛−) > ~103–104, whereas DAC would need 
𝐾CO2(R𝑛−) > ~105–106, both with the requirement that 𝐾CO2(R) < ~1.52,57  However, we note that 
these estimates are used for demonstration and should not be taken as exact guidelines, since 
specific values of required bindi ng coefficients will change depending upon other process factors, 
such as electrolyte  properties (e.g., carrier concentration and CO 2 solubility), operating 
parameters (e.g.  state of charge swing  and % CO 2 removal ), and system configuration.  These  
𝐾CO2(R𝑛−) and 𝐾CO2(R) estim ates were made assuming a 1 M carrier concentration , a CO 2 
solubility in the range of 0 .01–0.3 M atm-1, and use of a carrier that can bind one CO 2 molecule 
(𝑞 = 1). If the carrier concentration is decreased (relative to the CO 2 solubility), for example, 
required 𝐾CO2(R𝑛−) values would be higher, and faradaic efficiencies would also be reduced. 
These estimates also do not consider the fraction of CO 2 that is removed from the feed gas. In 
general, ideal redox carriers should have sufficient binding affinities ( 𝐾CO2(R𝑛−) and 𝐾CO2(R)), as 
well as high carrier concentration (both absolute and relative to CO 2 solubility), to enable 
operation at high separat ion capacities  and faradaic efficiencies . The ideal properties identified here were based upon maximization of the faradaic efficiency, although this  is not the only 
important performance metric. Prior work indicates that systems lacking cathodic absorptio n 
(e.g., 4 -stage system) may benefit from lower 𝐾CO 2(R𝑛−) values (which do not maximize the 
faradaic efficiency) due to an inherent tradeoff between faradaic and energetic efficiency in these 
systems.52 
The cell voltage ( 𝑉cell) can be generally represented as an equilibrium potential difference 
(𝐸cell) with the addition of overpotentials due to kinetics (𝜂s), mass transport ( 𝜂conc), and ohmics 
(𝜂ohm). This relation is shown in equation 3 for an electrolytic device.58 
|𝑉cell|=|𝐸cell|+|𝜂s|+|𝜂conc|+|𝜂ohm|                                                      3 
For operation at low cell voltages, overpotentials resulting from kinetics, mass transport, and 
ohmics should be minimized. This goal may be achieved with high carrier solubilities (permitting 
high co ncentrations), fast electrochemical kinetics, high diffusivities, and a highly conductive 
electrolyte.  These properties may also permit operation at high current densities.  
The equilibrium potential difference also impacts the cell voltage, and thus, shoul d also be 
minimized. This potential,  𝐸cell, is equal to the equilibrium potential difference between the 
cathode and anode. In an ideal system with a symmetric cell (as shown in Figure 1), the cathode 
will only carry out the carrier activation reaction fo r CO 2 capture, and the only reaction at the 
anode will be the carrier deactivation for CO 2 release. Thus, the equilibrium potentials for the 
cathode and anode can be represented with the Nernstian potentials for the activation (for capture) 
and deactivation (for release) reactions, which we define here as 𝐸cap and 𝐸rel, respectively. For 
ideal solutions, the equilibrium potentials, 𝐸cap and 𝐸rel, will be related to the standard reduction 
potentials, 𝐸1/2(cap ) and 𝐸1/2(rel), and species concentrations (bracketed, mol L-1) according to 
the Nernst equation, as shown in equations 4 and 5 for the S cheme 1 mechanism.  
𝐸cap=𝐸1/2(cap )−𝑅𝑇
𝑛𝐹ln([R𝑛−]
[R])                                                      4 
𝐸rel=𝐸1/2(rel)−𝑅𝑇
𝑛𝐹ln([R(CO2)𝑛−]
[R(CO2)])                                                      5 
Thus, the equilibrium potential difference, 𝐸cell, may be impacted by  the reduction  potentials, 
𝐸1/2(cap ) and 𝐸1/2(rel). More specifically, a larger difference between the reduction  potentials 
(Δ𝐸1/2 = 𝐸1/2(rel) – 𝐸1/2(cap )) of the electrochemical reactions can lead to high cell voltages and reduced energetic efficiencies. Ideally, low Δ𝐸1/2 would be preferred; however, this is challenged 
by an intrinsic relation between  𝐾CO2(R𝑛−)𝐾CO2(R) ⁄  and Δ𝐸1/2 (equation 6).  
Δ𝐸1/2=𝑅𝑇
𝑛𝐹ln(𝐾CO2(R𝑛−)
𝐾CO2(R))                                                          6 
From a thermodynamic  perspective , a larger 𝐾CO2(R𝑛−)𝐾CO2(R) ⁄  ratio can increase the driving 
force for CO 2 capture and release, which consequently introduces irreversibility into the system , 
resulting in larger cell voltages and thus lower energetic efficiencies. As a result, any 
thermodynamic driving force beyond the minimum required 𝐾CO2(R𝑛−)𝐾CO2(R) ⁄  for a spe cific 
concentration swing  may negatively impact system energetics . However, it has also been shown 
that this is dependent upon the choice of system configuration .51,56,59 For systems which 
implement both cathodic absorption and anodic desorption (i.e., a 2 -stage system), where CO 2 is 
fed to and removed from the electrodes, the thermodynamic driving force for capture and release 
is reduced (even at high 𝐾CO2(R𝑛−)𝐾CO2(R) ⁄  ratios). Considering the electrode potentials, the 
increase in Δ𝐸1/2 due to higher values of 𝐾CO2(R𝑛−)𝐾CO2(R) ⁄ is off set by favorable Nernstian 
potential shifts due to CO 2 binding at the cathode and CO 2 removal at the anode. For the 
configurations which lack cathodic absorption and/or anodic desorption, increasing the 
𝐾CO2(R𝑛−)𝐾CO2(R) ⁄   ratio can result in lower energetic efficiencies due to the inherently higher 
Δ𝐸1/2. This consideration is a vital factor in the design of redox carriers (and the overall system) . 
For example , a carrier capable of CO 2 concentration from atmospheric sources could theoretically 
be used to concentrate from flue gas . However, the latter system may operate at a lower efficien cy 
due to this increased standard reduction potential difference . 
Finally, the carrier should be sel ective towards CO 2 and stable  in both oxidized and reduced 
states . High selectivity and stability require the carrier to preferentially bind CO 2 in its activated 
state and avoid side reactions which can lead to undesirable  side products and/or species deca y. 
A current challenge within the field is that carriers that are reduced in  their activated state tend to 
react with di oxygen (O 2) and/or water vapor (H 2O) (Scheme 1) .60 For the former, the  reduced 
carrier can participate in redox chemistry with O 2, the most common of which is a one electron 
transfer event to re -generate the resting state (R) while also forming superoxide (O 2–) (Scheme 1, 
equation I ), reducing the overall faradaic efficiency for CO 2 capture. Perhaps more deleterious, 
the superoxide species can react irreversibly with the carrier, solvent, or electrolyte , negatively 
impacting long -term cycling stability.61,62 If the reduced carrier is sufficiently basic, it can also be protonated by  from water  or other acidic protons  in the solvent/carrier , reducing the carrier’s  
propensity to capture CO 2 (Scheme 1, equation II ).63  
In both atmospheric and industrial CO 2 capture applications, O 2 and H2O may be  present in 
large quantities . While pre -treatment of inlet gas streams is possible to preclude O2 and 
protonation sources, their implementation typically results in increased costs and d ecreased 
energetic efficiencie s; thus, ideal carrier s should be tolerant to O2 and H2O. The thermodynamic 
favorability for an electron transfer to O 2 (equation 7 ) is dictated by the standard reduction 
potential of the carrier ( 𝐸1/2(cap ) in the simplified mechanism ) as compared to the  O2/O2•- couple, 
(𝐸1/2(𝑂2/𝑂2•−)) which typically occurs at  ~ –1.2 V vs Fe(C 5H5)2+/0 in organic solvents.64,65 The 
free energy  of a protonation event , as shown in equation 8, is dictated  by the pKa  of (RH)(𝑛−1)−. 
More generally, the favorability of protonation is governed by the p Ka of the CO 2-binding site of 
a carrier as compared to the p Ka of other sites in the molecule, water, and/or protic media.  
Therefore, an optimal redox carrier for eCCC will have low pKa and more positive 𝐸1/2(cap ) 
values. However, as we describe in the following section, correlations exist between these 
properties and the CO 2 binding affinity, which challenge the achievement of these ideal 
conditions.  
 Overall, the se are the requirements that must be considered for high performance operation 
of eCCC systems. There are also many process factors which can be changed to improve 
performance, including molecular properties, operating conditions, and system design. However,  
this tutorial review  will focus  specifically on the molecular design of redox carriers by tuning the 
CO 2 binding affinity, standard reduction potential, and pKa. We describe the inherent relationships 
between these properties as well as how they may be impacted by the solvent environment. We 
outline approaches to designing redox carriers which have adequate CO 2 binding at mild potentials 
and low pKa values, and des cribe how theory and computational methods can be used to 
supplement and accelerate this design process.  
 
2. Survey of Redox Carrier  Molecules  
To be considered as a candidate CO 2 redox carrier, a molecule must contain both a CO 2-
binding site  and a redox -active site. CO 2 binding is associated with a pronounced reorganization 
in the CO 2 geometry, changing from a linear to a bent structure. In most cases, a neutral CO 2 
molecule binds via the electrophilic carbon atom to an electron -rich nucleoph ilic center , such as a metal  to form a metal carboxylate , an alkoxide to form a carbonate , or an amide to form a 
carbamate. Thus, for these redox carrier systems, the redox -active site must induce a substantial 
change in electron localization ( i.e., electr on density) at the CO 2-binding site to enhance  (or 
decrease)  its nucleophilicity , and therefore,  binding .60,66 The redox -active and binding sites can 
be the same (co -located) or distinct; however, if the two sites are separated, r eduction  (or 
oxidation ) at the redox -active site  must generate this change in electron density as describe d 
above .60,66 Early studies  noted the importance of proximity of the redox center to the CO 2 binding 
site, where it was found that shorter distances between the two sites resulted in larger  binding 
affinity differences between the activated and deactivated states of the carrier.67 The observed 
differences in CO 2 binding between  different oxidation states  of a carrier were negli gible when 
the sites were separated by more than a single atom, emphasizing the importance of electronic 
communication between the two sites.   
Several classes of organic molecules and transition metal complexes meet this requirement of 
having both a redox -active and CO 2 binding site, and have been assessed for their potential 
capabilities as a redox carrier for eCCC. Among  the organic compounds , thiols ,68,69 bipyr idines ,70–
72 and quinones have all demonstrated capabilities for eCCC; however, quinones are currently the 
most widely explored family of redox carrier molecu les and therefore will be a main focus of this 
tutorial review. Observed trends for previously reported carriers  will be discussed in the following 
sections . First, correlations  between redox -carrier  CO 2 binding affinity  and reduction potential , 
are discussed  for quinones  (Section 2.1) and transition metal complexes  (Section 2.2).  We then 
assess what these correlations imply fo r the design of effective yet stable redox carriers (Section 
2.3). 
 
2.1 Quinones (Organic Redox Carriers)  
Correlation Between CO 2 Binding  (𝑲𝐂𝐎𝟐) and Reduction Potential ( 𝑬𝟏/𝟐). In neutral aprotic 
media, quinones ( Q) typically undergo two sequential one -electron transfer events ( 𝑛 = 2 in 
Scheme 1). The quinone is first reduced to generate a semiquinone or radical anion ( QRA), and 
this reaction is characterized by a reduction  potential,  𝐸1/2(Q/QRA) in Scheme 2. The radical anion 
undergoes its second reduction step to form a dianion ( QDA), at a more negative reduction  
potential, 𝐸1/2(QRA/QDA).73 Previous work in eCCC has shown that quinones can bind CO 2 at one 
or both of the anionic oxyge n sites following reduction, corresponding to 𝑞 = 1 or 2 in the generalized reaction network shown in Scheme 1.  More specifically, it has been proposed that a  
quinone binds CO 2 via an ECEC or EEC mechanism, where E denotes an electron transfer step, 
C indicates a chemical step, and the notation indicates the order of these steps in the 
mechanism.49,51,52,74 The dis parity in mechanism likely arises from the thermodynamic 
favorability of CO 2 binding to a quinone radical anion species ( QRA), which is defined by the CO 2 
binding affinity for QRA, 𝐾CO2(RA). If CO 2 binds upon formation of QRA (ca. 𝐾CO2(RA) >> 𝐾CO2(Q) 
prior to further reduction to QDA, then an ECEC mechanism would predominate. However, if CO 2 
binding to QRA is unfavorable  (ca. 𝐾CO2(RA) ~ 𝐾CO2(Q)), then an EEC mechanism would  occur. A 
complication to this assessment, however, is if disproportionation of two QRA molecules 
transpires to create Q and QDA, which then reacts with CO 2, as shown at the top of  Scheme 
2.66,75,76 Disproportionation would result in inflated values for 𝐾CO2(RA) and may falsely suggest 
an ECEC mechanism if not properly considered.  
 
Scheme 2.   
  Quinones have an affinity for  CO 2 in their reduced forms ( QDA and sometimes QRA). 
Reported CO 2 binding constants with quinone dianions ( 𝐾CO2(DA)) have been shown to vary 
between < 10 to > 1018 (Table 2).63,66,67 Although , numerous quinones have been observed to bind 
CO 2 in their radical anion state ( QRA), only two values for 𝐾CO2(RA) have been reported  to da te, 
for PAQ and DtBBQ.66,67 These reported binding constants for both radical anions ( 𝐾CO2(RA)) were 
several orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding values for the dianions ( 𝐾CO2(DA)). 
Although no other values of 𝐾CO2(RA) have been quantitatively determined, studies by cyclic 
voltammetry suggest that 𝐾CO2(RA) is usually much smaller than 𝐾CO2(DA).63,66,67,77 –79 The disparity 
between CO 2 binding of each species is likely due to increased nucleophilicity of the oxygen atoms 
in the dianion.

 A correlation exists betw een CO 2 binding affinity of a carrier and its reduction  potential.  For 
quinones tested in DMF, Dubois and coworkers observed a linear relationship between the second 
reduction potential, 𝐸1/2(QRA/QDA), and the logarithm of the binding coefficient of the dianion, 
log(𝐾CO 2(DA)).66 Figure 2 (left) shows log(𝐾CO2(DA)) vs. 𝐸1/2(QRA/QDA) for various quinones in 
DMF, DMSO, and MeCN solvents (data from Table 2). Intra-molecular interactions and side 
reactions  with CO 2 disrupt the linear relationship in Figure 2, left.  Ogura and coworkers note that 
quinones featuring intramolecular hydrogen -bonding interactions  (indicated by ** in Table 2)  
display significantly lower CO 2 binding capabilities.63 Additionally, several quinones have been 
observed to decompose via Kolbe -Schmitt81,82 reactions if C –H bonds are present α to the quinone 
carbonyl groups.63,66,67,83 –85 The side reactivity of these quinones may lead to inaccurate 
measurements of 𝐾CO2(DA). If the quinones featuring hydrogen -bond ing interactions or Kolbe -
Schmidt decomposition are removed from the plot (Figure 2, left), the linear trend becomes more 
apparent  (Figure 2, right). The data in Figure 2  were  collected in  polar aprotic solvents ; the effects 
of protic or non -polar solvents  (as well as cation effects from the supporting salt) may affect this 
observed linear trend.  
2.2 Transition Metal Complexes  
Transition metals  also have the potential to serve as CO 2 redox  carriers  by forming a new σ 
bond between the metal and the electrophilic carbon of CO 2.83,86 The strength of CO 2 binding 
(i.e., CO 2 binding coefficient) tends to trend with nucleophilicity . For example, in  1978 , Evans et 
al. reported that  CO 2 binding by metal carbonyl anions and empirical nucleophilicities correlated 
with the reaction rates.87   A trend between the CO 2 binding affinity and reduction  potential has also been observed for 
transition metal complexes. The stability of the metal -carboxylate adducts , which are formed 
upon CO 2 binding,  correlates  with the  M(II/I) reduction potentials.83,86 –89 In transition metal 
complexes reported to -date, those with reduction potentials negative of -1.90 V vs. Fc+/0 exhibit 
irreversible CO 2 binding, while those with reduction potentials positive of -1.7 V  vs. Fc+/0 do not 
react directly with CO 2. Thus, there is only a narrow window in which reversible CO 2 binding is 
likely to occur, as shown in Figure 3 (left).  Due to this limited window, very few measurements 
on reversible CO 2 binding constants have been made on tr ansition metal complexes; of note is a 
series Ni(I) and Co(I) tetra -aza macrocyclic complexes described by Lewis and co -workers .83 A 
plot of the binding affinity, log(𝐾CO2(I)), with the reduction  potential, 𝐸1/2(I/II)), results in  a linear 
free energy relationship that correlates more  reducing metal centers with stronger, reversible CO 2 
binding  (Figure 3, left) . A similar relationship has been observed in a series of related macrocyclic 
cobalt complexes.84 
However, even within this limited data set, other factors that contribute to CO 2 binding are evident 
that can break this correlation. For instance, the presence of two individual conformers of 
Me 6[14]-4,11-diene chelate highlighted the importance of flexibility  and sterics  on CO 2 binding 
affinities.83 Although the Co complex es with the Me 6[14]-4,11-diene ligand in  the d,l and meso

for various quinones reported in DMSO (green triangles), DMF (red squares), or MeCN (blue 
diamonds). Left figure includes quinones that feature intramolecular hydrogen -bonding 
interactions (circled in black) as well as quinones observed to undergo Kolbe -Schmitt 
decomposition p athways in the presence of CO 2 (circled in orange). Figure on the right shows 
that a strong linear correlation exists when the circled quinones with secondary effects or 
decomposition are removed.   
Figure 3.  All data are taken from ref. 83. Left:  A relationship of CO 2 binding constants (log K) 
against M(II/I) reduction potentials of different ML complexes; M = Co, Ni. The measurements 
were obtained in DMSO solution and reported M(II/I) potentials are referred to the 
ferrocenium/ferrocene (Fc+/0) redox couple. An irreve rsible binding was observed for complexes 
with reduction potentials more negative than ‒1.90 V; the binding constants for complexes with 
potentials more positive than ‒1.70 V were too low to be measured. Right:  A relationship of CO 2 
binding constants (log K) against dielectric constants ( εε0⁄) of the used solvent. The 
measurements were obtained in propylene carbonate, DMSO, DMF, MeCN, and THF.   
 
configurations have identical reduction potentials, the d, l has a  CO 2 binding constant that is nearly 
two orders of magnitude larger (cf. Figure 3, left) The inhibited binding from the meso  isomer is 
likely due to steric  factors that impact  CO 2-binding.  
At the same time , improved CO 2 adduct stabilization  for these metal macrocycles may  be due 
to increased hydrogen bonding interactions between the amine hydrogens and the CO 2 oxygen 
atoms in the d,l configuration. Thus, secondary interactions could be useful  in the design of  new 
generations of both metal -based and organic carriers. For instance, a number of solvent and 
electrolyte effects on CO 2 binding to metals  are documented ,83 includ ing: (i) stabilization of 
reactants/products in different solvents as the effect of solvent polarity, (ii) coordination  of a 
solvent molecule as an axial ligand in the ML complexes, (iii) degree of solvation of alkali ions 
or electrolyte cations, (iv) hydrogen bonding interactions , and (v) CO 2 solubility. Figure 3 (right)  
shows a trend between log(𝐾CO2(I)) and solvent diele ctric constants ( εε0⁄, given  as a measure of 
solvent polarities). A positive correlation is observed, which may  be a result of  higher stabilization 
of CO 2 adducts (metal carboxylates) in more polar solvents  and/or  increased  CO 2 solubility.  
The presence of ion-pairing may complicat e the understanding of solvent effects on CO 2 
binding. CO 2 binding affinity has been shown to improve with the assistance of the  acidic 
partners, such as alkali cations (M+).88 A concerted attack of Co(I) on the electrophilic carbon of 
CO 2 and M+ interaction with the basic oxygen of CO 2 was observe d for bimetallic Co(salen)M 
complexes.88,90 Therefore, the extent of solvation of the alkali ions or electrolyte cations in the 
solution may significantly influence the measu red log(𝐾CO2(I)). As an example, Li+ ions greatly 
increase the binding affinity in comparison to, e.g., tetrabutylammonium cations that have the less 
localized negative charge density.83,90 Lastly, the effect of Li+ cations on CO 2 stabilization is more 
dramatic in THF than in DMSO. This is probably due to a better solvation of Li+ in DMSO, 
making the cations less accessible for CO 2 stabilization.   
 
2.3 Design Implications for Stable Carriers  
O2 Stability  
O2 stability of reduced quinones requires reduction potentials positive of the O 2/O2•- 
couple.60,68,70,72,91 Very reducing redox carriers (with reduction potentials negative of this couple) 
can be oxidized by O2, to produce superoxide ( O2•-) and regenerate the resting -state carrier 
(Scheme 1, equation I ). A cleavage of the C‒C bond  between the carbonyl groups  was observed 
in the reaction of alpha -diketones (including 1,2 -quinones) in air -saturated solution under 
electrochemical conditions.62 This decomposition  mechanism was attributed to a fast radical 
coupling of O 2•‒ and the diketone ( quinone) anion radical simultaneously present in a solution, 
producing the corresponding dicarboxylate species.  However, more negative  (cathodic)  reduction 
potentials of redox c arriers also results in increased CO 2 affinity,63,66,67,83 –85 causing more potent 
CO 2 carriers to also be more sensitive to O 2. Accordingly, the 𝐸1/2(QRA/QDA) vs. log(𝐾CO2(DA)) 
plots shown in Figure 2 r eveal that none of the quinones  are reduced at potentials less negative 
than the O 2/O2•‒ potential while maintaining appreciable binding constants  (log(𝐾CO2(DA))>4) . 
This direct correlation between desired and undesired reactivities requires more detailed 
consideration of chemical  property correlations to design redox carrier -based eCCC systems.  
To develop carriers selective for CO 2 binding in the oxygenated atmosphere, they must bind  
CO 2 at more positive  potentials without sacrificing the desirable nucleophilicity. This goal could 
potentially be achieved by attaching additional auxiliary substituents to include non -covalent 
interactions for CO 2 binding at its nucleophilic oxygen atoms, e.g., through elect rostatics or 
hydrogen bonding.63,83,92 This approach can be use d for both organic and transition metal 
complexes. Some of the quinones p ossessing proton donors (e.g., hydroxyl groups) have been  synthesized.61 However, the hydroxyl groups in the semiquinones react ed rapidly with molecular 
oxygen to form hydroperoxide anion radicals – which can further release  superoxides – so other 
CO 2 stabilization might be required.61  
 
H2O Stability  
As described above, redox carriers with more cathodic potentials will increase the nucleophilicity 
of the redox carrier, which leads to  an increa se in log(𝐾CO2). However, more cathodic potentials  
also correlates with Brönsted basicity  with quinone s93–95 and transition metals.96  The positive 
correlation between log(𝐾CO2) and pKb is a challenge to the desi gn of stable carriers , as 
sufficiently basic carriers may deprotonate H2O instead of capturing CO 2. From the  very limited  
kinetic  data reported for quinone CO 2 reactivity, protonation of the reduced quinone species is  
kinetically favored  over CO 2 binding.66,75,78 Protonation of anthraquinone has been observed to 
be twice as fast as CO 2 binding in DMSO.78 Careful matching of solvent and quinone pKa and 
preclusion of acidic proton sources are necessary to prevent kinetic inhibition of eCCC due to 
protonation.   
Although Brönsted basicity is an important parameter to consider for redox carriers, capture 
can still be performed with an R𝑛− that is more basic than OH-. In these cases, it is expected that 
R𝑛− will deprotonate water to generate OH-, which will then react with CO 2 to form bicarbonate 
or carbonate. The change in basicity of R/R𝑛− effectively changes the pH of the solution to 
capture and release CO 2 instead of binding CO 2 directly. These pH swing systems have been 
described in more detail in recent reviews.97,98 
 
Other Effects on Stability  
Carrier s can be deactivated by the irreversible binding of the CO 2 molecule. This mechanism  was 
observed for some metal -based carriers with highly negative M(II/I) reduction  potentials83 as well 
as for several quinone molecules that possess ortho - or para - hydrogens relative to the quinone 
carbonyl groups.60,66 In these cases, the Kolbe -Schmidt carboxylation reaction is viable,99 
rendering an adduct that does not allow the CO 2 release. A prominent example of this class of 
compounds is the inactivation of p-benzoquinone after few CO 2 capture/release cycles providing 
2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid.75 
 3. Molecular Engineering of Redox Carriers  
Investigation of trends observed in prior work has shown that the key properties for redox 
carriers - nucleophilicity, basi city, and reduction potentials - are correlated.  Generally, i ncreased 
nucleophilicity is expected to result in greater affinity for CO 2; however,  this usually comes with 
a more negative reduction potential and increased p Ka due to linear free energy relationships 
(LFER) , presenting challenges in optimizing all three properties . A more detailed consideration 
of chemical property correlations to find  characteristics that break these linear free energy 
relationships is required to effectively design redox carrier molecules for eCCC systems.   
Molecular engineering is the practice  of m odifying the structure of a parent molecule  
(substituent/ligand environments)  to tune its molecular properties , as an optimization task , and 
has been successfully applied to various families of functional molecules  or molecular 
catalysts .100–104 Similar to the drug design industry, t he role of theory in th e molecular design 
workflow is unitary : it offers trends or insights to guide experimental wo rk (which is much more 
time- and resource -consuming) , meriting  low-cost and rapid iteration in access ing a larger 
chemical space and examin ing a pool of potential candidates. However, since the accurate 
prediction of redox potential and binding energies requires free energy calculation at chemical 
accuracy, the choice of theoretical model is sensitive  and multiple realistic aspects may need to 
be included.  
In the following subsections we will discuss the theoretical methods , from computational 
methods to realistic modeling techniques , for calculating molecular properties and free energetics 
at chemical accuracy . We will also give a discussion  on the  inverse design strategies enabled by 
recent developments  in semi -empirical methods, global optimization algorithms, data science and 
machine learning models.  
 
3.1 Redox Carrier Design with Theoretical Methods  
Molecular association in a solution can be viewed as a multi -step process (Figure 4) that 
consists of: (i) change in geometry from the equilibrium structures of the free reactants to the 
geometry of the product, (ii) electronic  structure reorganization associat ed with the formation of 
new chemical bonds or strong intermolecular interactions, and (iii) change in the solvation 
environment as the two solvation spheres begin to interact  and eventually merge . Besides the 
electronic structure methods , the correct description in computations thus demands a robust protocol for evaluation of free energies of the equilibrium and transition -state structures  of the 
species involved.  
 
Figure 4.  The CO 2 binding in aqueous solution by a prototypical tetrachl oro-p-benzoquinone 
(TCBQ) carrier . Within the association, the free reagents ( left) approach each other to form a ‘pre -
reaction’ bimolecular complex ( middle ). This complex is mainly stabilized by the interactions 
with the neighboring solvent molecules, mak ing an accurate description of the change in solvent 
configurational entropy a critical factor for the precision of quantum chemical calculations. The 
driving force for the association is the formation of a stable molecular entity ( right ), which is 
regular ly accompanied by a significant change in the geometries of the interacting species (e.g., 
bending of the CO 2 molecule) and electronic structure adjustment as the new chemical bonds are 
formed.  
 
Sampling of the molecular conformational space  
In the real reaction system, the molecule s exist  as ensemble s of different conformatio ns 
surrounded by different solvent  configurations and under the influence of non -uniform external 
fields. Since the macroscopic observables are essentially thermodynamic ensemble averages, 
each accessible configuration contributes  to the ensemble. Capturing such a tremendous number 
of degrees  of freedom is impractical, but including one or a few of them make s the model more 
realistic and closer to the physical reality.   
According to the Eyring equation, molecules can move across barriers of ~20 kcal/mol on the 
timescale of minutes at room temp erature, and all isomers within ca. 3 kcal/mol could have a 
significant population. Sampling the huge and complex conformational space with chemical 
accuracy is therefore an algorithmic challenge for its sheer size. Cheminformatics methods are 
perhaps the most common and affordable choices for the purpose, which include machine learning 
models fitted to experimental crystal structure s or scripting heuristic rules to build the geometry 
‘fragment by fragment’ according to local connectivity.105 The knowledge -based algorithms 
enable the generation of putative global minimum conformer on a personal computer in 
milliseconds, but the a priori  geometric constraint also excludes some parts of the conformational 
space. Another class of easily affordabl e methods is the stochastic or systematic torsion scan using 
molecular mechanics (MM) force field.106,107 Although more grounded physically, they rely on 
the pro per parametrization of the force field. As a result, the PES may still be far from chemical 
accuracy, especially in the regions where noncovalent interactions dominate. To describe the 
energy landscape more accurately, one needs to employ QM methods with a n efficient potential 
energy surface  sampling (owing to a much higher computational cost of the local optimization 
steps). Ensembles generated at a lower level of theory (MM or semiempirical QM) with a higher 
energy cutoff could serve as decent samples, in cluding those from systematic or stochastic torsion 
scan, simulated annealing, high -T molecular dynamics trajectory, meta -dynamics simulation 
etc.108–112  
 
Modeling of the solvent environment  and electrochemical condition s 
The interaction between the solvent molecules and the solute is known to affect the energetics 
of chemical reactions, and the relative stability of the low -energy conformers.113 Accordingly, the 
fully explicit treatment of the solvent would be ideal for capturing the specific interatomic 
interactions. However, s ince the weak interactions vanish beyond ~4 Å, the explicit QM treatment 
of only the inner -shell solvent molecules (i.e., microsolvation approach) is a natural 
approximation to the problem. Including several explicit solvent molecules allows the interactio n 
between solvent and carrier to be studied explicitly, and some intermediate structure that must be 
stabilized by solvent can be thereby recovered.114 Such a molecular cluster is notorious for a flat 
potential energy surface , and a more sophisticated sampling  technique is needed. Several 
algorithms have be en adapted to treat the microsolvation model, including particle swarm 
optimization, genetic algorithm, and basin hopping.115–117 In terms of energetics, microsolvation 
models can help to reduce the mean unsigned error of solvation free energy to less than ca. 1.5 
kcal/mol;  if a proper number of e xplicit water molecules is adopted.118 Note that this solvation 
free energy is dependent on the number of explicit waters, since diverse solvated molecules have 
different molecular volume and charge distribution that requires altered number of explicit 
solvent molecules to mimic best the geometry of the solvation complex in a real solution. Even if 
a decent number of solvent molecules is chosen, the geometry from microsolvation model would 
still be di fferent from the real solvation environment due to the absence of outer shell solvent 
molecules that affect the orientation and arrangement of the inner shell solvents. A recent study show ed that the microsolvation model can treat different classes of molecules consistently and 
reproduce the experimental values only after including more than 20 explicit water molecules,.119  
Except for the inconsisten t performance  over molecules of different kinds  (dipole, charge 
state, solvent -accessible area) , the microsolvation model als o fails to capture the configurational 
entropy of solvent molecules in a real solution, which is essentially a common drawback of all 
quantum chemical (QC) calculations based on static models , where the entropy comes  only from 
a single Hessian . To capture the free energy change of the reaction system in solution, in this 
context, specifically CO 2 binding/release, one -electron reduction/oxidation, and 
protonation/deprotonation, the statistical mechanical methods outperform “static”  methods. Two 
major approac hes to free energy calculation are free energy perturbation (FEP) and 
thermodynamic integration (TI).120 In FEP, the system is perturbed along the reactio n coordinate, 
and the total free energy is expressed by summing the successive intermediate steps. In TI, the 
generalized force is averaged over the sampled configurational space. Due to the statistical nature 
of FEP and TI, sufficient sampling is required , and the samples can be from Monte Carlo 
simulation or molecular dynamics trajectory.121,122 Umbrella sampling can be incorporated to 
further improve the sampling of the hindered regions in the configurational space.123 Combined 
with QM/MM, statistical mechanical methods can treat hundreds if not thousands of explicit water  
molecules  routinely, reproduc ing experimental energetics of deprotonation and zwitt erion 
dissociation of biomolecules in realistic water solvation, and provide rich chemical insight into 
the reaction process.124,125  
At the electrochemical interface, the local environment becomes much more complex. In 
addition to the carrier molecule and the surrounding solvent molecules, there would be a solid -
state electrode, electrolyte forming a double electric layer, and the non -uniform electric field 
throughout the region. Endeavo rs have been made  to model  this kind of an interface at an atomic 
scale;  one of the most popular is the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) model which 
converts slab -in-vacuum energetics into corresponding potential values via a linear relationship  
between reaction free energy and electrode potential .126 The CHE  model has been applied to a 
wide range of electrocatalytic systems and demonstrated to qualitatively  agree  with experimental 
trends; however, it only holds for  the systems with coupled proton -electron transfer and cannot 
account for polarization of the ad sorbate at the charged electrode surface. A more theoretical 
sound treatment is the grand canonical DFT model which connects the system of study to a reservoir of electrons  and allow the number of electrons in the system to vary, so as to  model 
constant -potential  chemistries . This can be achieved  by charging the system with fractional 
numbers of electrons , combined with the linearized Poisson -Boltzmann equation  for continuum 
behaviour , to avoid a spur ious excess charge and provides much mo re realistic description of an 
electric double  layer. Such a model has been successfully applied to reveal potential -dependent 
reaction energetics of CO 2 electro reduction127 and quantitatively reproduced the adsorption 
configuration switching of adsorbate on electrode surface at different applied potentials.128 
Although in eCCC no explicit electrochemical conversion of CO 2 is involved, the adsorption 
behavior and CO 2 binding capacity of a carrier at the electrode could be different as that in the 
bulk solution, which can represent  an extra dimension for optimization.  
Another factor in designing or simulating a new carrier is the stability of  the molecular 
structure. In addition to the structure that has substituents with intrinsic instability such as acid 
chlorides, anhydrides, cyclopentadienes, aziridines, enamines, hemiaminals, enol ethers, 
cyclobutadiene, cycloheptatriene etc.,129 some moieties , for example, alpha bromide or iodide 
(good leaving group), alpha ester and carbonyl (subject to hydrolysis), may appear stable in gas 
phase simulation but destabilize in protic solvent when the carrier is reduced to an anion or binds 
a CO 2. Capturing carrier stability  thus requires introduc tion of  a sufficient number of explicit 
solvent molecules and sample beyond the chemical space of interest. Molecular dynamics or 
meta -dynamics simulation would provide  an information on stability by tracing the conn ectivity 
along the traj ectory, but routinely applying a stability check on every candidate molecule is 
computational demanding. Therefore, the chemical space must be cautiously defined before the 
production run; otherwise, a series  of molecules that are se emingly practical but unstable under 
reaction conditions may be generated.  
 
Energetics of the CO 2 binding  
Bond -breaking/forming process itself is highly sensitive to the level of theory since the change 
in bonding is accompanied by a change in the charge l ocalization in the bound/unbound states, 
charge transfer from one molecule to a binding region, a significant change in the dispersion in 
going from the free reactants to the product and  increasing the static (non -dynamical) correlation. 
All of these effec ts are highly problematic for, e.g., the conventional treatment at the density 
functional theory (DFT) level, since the method neglects the long -range correlation.130 Some of the shortcomings may be alleviated by resigning on the kinetic description of the process and 
focusing only on the thermodynamic (equilibrium) binding . Then, the equilibrium constant of the 
reaction can be obtained from the free energy difference between the reactant and the product . 
For electron donor -accepto r type CO 2 physisorption , in which CO 2 acts as a Lewis acid and 
the CO 2-philic center as a Lewis base , hydrogen bonding interactions exhibit importance in 
binding. As an example, a relatively strong interaction was observed between CO 2 and purine 
molecule (~23 kJ/mol at the CCSD(T)/CBS level), as depicted in Figure 5A .131 The preferred in -
plane binding mode is controlled by the donation of the electron density from nitrogen atom to 
an electrophilic carbon of the CO 2 group, and the weak hydrogen bond is stabilizing the resulting 
complex. In Figure 5B, the π -π interaction be tween CO 2 and the aromatic ring is illustrated. This 
interaction is another significant contribution to CO 2 binding, which was documented, e.g., in ref. 
132, and postulated to be crucial for  effectively tuning the uptake efficiency by various metal -
organic frameworks (MOFs) or zeolite materials designed for CO 2 adsorption and separation. At 
last, a different binding pattern was uncovered by Ruiz -Lopez and co -workers, showing the dual 
role of CO 2 as both Lewis acid and Lewis base when interacting with some carbonyl 
compounds.133 A cooperative carbonyl -CO 2 π-π* interaction ( Figure 5C ) was demonstrated to 
have comparable interaction energy as the conventional binding.  
Regarding the  computationa l methods, the correlation energy was demonstrated to play a 
critical role for accurate energetics, with dispersion forces accounting for ca. 40 % of the total 
interaction.131 Therefore, the post -HF methods were often employed to study interactions of CO 2 
with many organic molecules, such as N-containing heterocycles131 and polyheterocycles,134 
amines,135 organic solvents,136 aromatic molecules,132 carbonyl groups,133,137 –139 and other small 
organic molecules.140  
Although the DFT methods were revealed to behave unreliably in the prediction of the 
stability of complexes in Figure 5C (as compared to the CCSD(T)/DZ level of theory),133 the DFT 
methods are quite acc urate for the weak intermolecular interactions in general , as documented in 
many benchmark articles.141–151 Their outcomes should be well applicable also for CO 2 binding 
equilibrium, especially when combined with the additional dispersion correction methods (e.g., 
Grimme’s D3 empirical dispersion correction152). Then,  the DFT methods tend to recover up to 
ca. 90 % of the correlation energy and closely approach the CCSD(T)/CBS limit.

oxygen atom of CO 2 and an amine group of purine. B. The π -π interaction may become dominant 
in the aromatic systems. C. The dual electron donor -acceptor character of CO 2 is pronounced in 
its interaction with carbonyl groups . 
 
Further complications might arise when CO 2 is covalently bonded  to the (redox) carrier. In 
this case , the formation of various reaction intermediates can occur, following the initial CO 2 
uptake. Their potential interconversion and/or decomposition make the computational treatment 
difficult, due to  the potential energy surface possibly varying dramatically depending on the 
solvation model ( vide supra ). As an example, t here seems to be a cl ear consensus that amine 
functionalities bind CO 2 with a  direct/indirect participation of the solvent molecules, which also 
assist  in the stabilization of formed intermediates . Inconsistencies in the theoretical models thus 
mostly originate in the improper modeling of the solvent environment, leading to many 
contrasting results on the CO 2 binding mechanism. Still, theoretical calculations are important to  
understanding correlatio ns between CO 2 binding energies and various substituents effects, 
basicities or nucleophilicities of the CO 2-binding centers, or their influence in the CO 2 
stabilization via hydrogen -bonding.   
As far as the redox eCCC carriers are concerned, the number of computational studies is 
relatively limited and only exceptionally they extend the standard QM (DFT) with the implicit 
solvation model approach. On the other hand, the reliability of the methods is often enhanced by 
their correlation or direct co nnection w ith the experiments. A few examples, which include the 
reaction mechanism for the CO 2 capture by 4,4’ -bipyridine (bipy)72 and N-methyl -4,4’-bipyridine 
(Mebipy)71, were  investigated using DFT (B3LYP and M062X) with the implicit solvation model 
(IEFPCM or PCM ). The computations revealed that a stable adduct is formed between the radical 
anion of bipy or Mebipy and the CO 2 molecule, with the Δ G0 = ‒43.9 kJ/mol or ‒59 kJ/mol; 
supporting the results from the CV experiments. The release of the CO 2 molecule was accomplished by re -oxidation of the adduct, yielding a zwitterionic intermediate susceptible to 
decarboxylation.  
In ref. 68, benzyl disulfide -benzyl thiolate electrochemical cycle was studied computationally 
at the DFT (B3LYP) level, estimat ing the binding energy of CO 2 to benzyl thiolate of ca. ‒66 
kJ/mol. A significant electron density localized at the S -C bond of the thiolate and carbon of the 
CO 2 molecule suggests that upon oxidation, the destabilization should lead to the rapid CO 2 
relea se. Similarly, based on the DFT results from ref.  153, benzyl telluride and benzyl selenide 
were proposed  as potential eCCC agents, as they should have a better peak -to-peak separation 
between the CO 2 capture and CO 2 release potentials.  
Finally, b etter energetics with the G3MP2//B3LYP composite method w ith the CPCM 
solvation model were  obtained to explain the different reactivit ies of p-benzoquinone (BQ) and 
tetrafluoro -p-benzoquinone (TFBQ) toward CO 2 capture.77 BQ was show n to capture CO 2 after 
the first reduction in the  semiquinone state  (ECE C mechanism ), while TFBQ was proposed to 
react with CO 2 only after the full (two -electron) reduction was accomplished  (EEC  mechanism ). 
The lower reactivity of the TFBQ semiquinone was explained based on the lower nucleophilicity 
of the quinone oxygens due to the electron -withdrawing fluorine atoms. Also, the calculations 
revealed that TFBQ binds CO 2 at the oxygen atom, forming the carbonate product (favored by 
~ 88 kJ/mol over the carboxylate), while the BQ prefers carboxylate by ~  10 kJ/mol. However, a 
faster rate toward carbonate formation should circumvent the carboxylate product, which was 
also validated by the experimental infrared absorption spectroscopy.154 
CO 2 binding has also been heavily studied in various organic diamines (such as hydrazine, 
piperazine, etc.), carbonaceous materials, metal/covalent organic frameworks (MOFs/COFs), 
ultrathin membranes, organic polymers, zeolites, and others, which further complicate the 
discussion. Many of these systems were reviewed quite recently, with focus on both experimental 
and theoretical evaluation of the CO 2 interactions, and the interested reader should be referred to 
relevant articles and references therein (see, e.g., refs. 155–157). 
 
3.2  Inverse Design of Redox Carriers   
Computational High Throughput Screening  
An alternative to the bottom -up rational design  (based on understanding of the molecular 
system and substituent effects)  is the top -down inverse design methods that start with a  desired property before defining the chemical space. One inverse design approach is the computational 
high throughput screening or high throughput virtual screening. Assuming there is no prior 
knowledge about the chemistry or structure -property relationship, the s earch starts blindly from 
an expansive library of different kinds of molecules, and multiple filtering processes are gone 
through to eliminate the unfit molecules, finally reaching a small pool of promising candidates 
with outstanding properties ( Figure 6 ). Such practice has been applied to in silico  drug design by 
the pharmaceutical industry for decades. Empowered  by the huge and growing quantity of 
molecules stored in open databases,133 researchers can filter through entries to prepare a library 
of molecules with the help of cheminformatics tools such as OpenBabel,158 RDKit,159 and 
Indigo.160 The notable databases include ChemSpider,161 ChEMBL,162 PubChem,163 ZINC,164 and 
eMolecules,165 with each specializing in different aspects like bioactivity, physical properties, and 
commercial availability.  
 
Figure 6.  Comparison of the general molecular design workflow via three different strategies: 
direct design (upper row),  inverse design by computational high throughput screening (middle 
row), and inverse design with generative machine learning model (lower row). A dapted from 
reference129,166. 
 
Based on the prepared library of molecules, property descriptors can be constructed to “score” 
each candidate. Standard techniques include fingerprinting, substructure matching, surface 
matching to check similarit ies against a known active molecule or substrate. QSAR models, 
clustering and partitioning, can also be readily applied to the filtering process using multiple 
structures as input.167  
The techniques mentioned above can achieve extremely fast screening speed s; however, as 
the library is rendered to a smaller size, their performance worsens due to loss of physical and 
chemical information in these  oversimplified representations. In such cases, switching back to 
more “physical” model can help recover some proper ties and insights. Molecular mechanics 
methods, despite successful application to large systems in the last few decades,168 is 
outperformed by recently developed efficient quantum chemical methods. The linear -scaling 
semiempirical method MOZYME -PMn,169 tight-binding method GFNn -xTB,170 and revised low -
cost density functional method B97 -3c171 can all routinely deal with system of hundreds of atoms 
on a single processor while providing quantum mechanically meaningful results. Although their 
accuracy may be off by a few kcal/mol compared to advanced ab initio  methods, they are  capable  
of cutting down the library to a much more tractable size for advanced QM treatment . It is worth 
noting that, in 2019, Jensen et al.  performed high throughput virtual screening through a chemical 
space of 200 billion molecules in search of energy storage carrier with PM3 and GFN2 -xTB,172 
demonstrating the sheer efficiency of semiempirical methods in virtual screening.  
 
Generative Machine Learning  Models  
Althou gh computational high -throughput screening can greatly expand the investigated 
chemical space from the experience and intuition of a chemist to all known compounds ever 
synthesized by the whole community, it is still a small  and uneven sampling  subset of t he 
complete chemical space . This is where one must go beyond the limit of current 
synthetic/commercial accessibility  and resort to generative machine learning (ML) models. A 
schematic for the general workflow of inverse molecular design with ML is shown in  Figure 6  
The molecules are mapped by an encoder into a vector search space for ML where a certain 
descriptor is maximized or minimized, and then the vectors are converted back to the human -
readable molecular format by a decoder. Generating molecular struc tures that are outside the box 
but within chemical sense is the major challenge in inverse design with ML, because the ML models need a search space with well -defined metric and compact embedding of molecular 
features to ensure that the algorithms and opti mizations are efficient and that the outputs are 
meaningful. Generative  tasks are extremely sensitive to the representation of molecular structures, 
and whether a proper representation is adopted could make or break.166  
For predictive tasks, the molecular representations that only cover information of lo cal 
environments would be sufficient , such as bag -of-bonds173 which summarizes pairwise bonding 
entities in a molecule, and fingerprint174 which counts the num ber of occurrences of different 
chemical fragments in a molecule. However, they are not suitable for a generative model, which 
relies heavily on the invertibility of the representation, i.e., the capability to robustly convert into 
or back from a molecular  structure that makes chemical sense. This has something to do with the 
different nature of the two tasks: a specific property usually depends on a local region near the 
active site or whether a certain kind of substituent is present, so a minimal represen tation that can 
include those would be enough and efficient; but to generate new structures, one needs to establish 
a robust mapping between points in the vectorized search space to the real -world molecules; 
otherwise the optimization is likely to lead to a nonsense vector that stands for nothing at all.  
The XYZ coordinates or Z -matrix, which are standard representation s for ab initio calculations, 
straightforwardly describe the atomic positions but are not suitable for ML models since they either 
could not  offer a description of the intrinsic structural features or are difficult to be convert into 
consistent matrix representations due to undefined length/size . If the desired sea rch space is 
relatively local, e.g. , all 3 -substituted quinones, one can natural ly define a parent system where the 
substituent positions are predefined and then one -hot encode the ligands’ type and position into an 
M×N-D vector where the M is the size of ligand pool and N is the number of possible sites. Such 
representation allows ex ploration of chemical space of size ~ MN (permutations included), which 
can then be feed to global optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithm to locate the extrema 
of a specific property.172,175 However, such discretized and fixed -dimensionality encoding entirely 
relies on chemical knowledge of the system, therefore confining the search space in the predefined 
space.  
Focusing on the atomi c connectivity in a molecule leads to molecular graphs where only 
information of atom types (as nodes) and connectivity (as edges) are retained, e.g., SMILES176 and 
SMARTS.177 Such representations “translate” the geometry into a 1D string text by a grammar 
based on empirical bonding principles in a molecule, which offers a higher level of abstraction while maintaining readability. However, the NLP -like search space suffers from discretization, 
which makes the model not directly suitable for generative ML tasks, because simple vectorization 
of SMILES would lead to generation of nonsense strings that are rejec ted by their strict grammar. 
One solution then is to train a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework to encode the discrete 
strings into a point in continuous latent space, which is readily available for interpolation, 
optimization, and random exploration.129 Within the latent space, one can implement local or 
global optimization algorithms combined with predictive models to evaluate the property 
descriptor at each point and optimize toward a maximized property. After the optimization, the 
points in latent space  with descriptors above a certain criterion can be converted back into the 
original representation format with another decoder model. It requires teaching the encoder and 
decoder models to read and write in SMILES grammar, and such additional training and validation 
need to be repeated for each different class of molecules. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) 
can do a similar job by co -training a discriminator model and a fake generator model to judge 
whether a string -based representation is legal or not.  GAN, when combined with the latent space 
approach, has been reported to work well in both random generation and target biased 
generation,178 but it requires a larger volume of pre -training data and mor e hyperparameter 
tuning.179 
Another solutio n is to devise a more robust string -based representation that translates even 
entirely random strings to practical molecular structures. Aspuru -Guzik  et al. recently proposed 
Self-Referencing Embedded Strings (SELFIES) to be a 100% robust string -based repr esentation 
that covers the complete chemical space of molecules through a self -referencing syntax.180 
SELFIES can be directly used in designing workflow without further adaptation or 
encoder/decoder training. Coulomb matrix is  emerging as another promising molecular 
representation. It is essentially a sparse matrix that contains pairwise Coulombic forces between 
atoms, which entails richer physical information, and is principally suitable for tasks related to 
electronic propert ies.181,182 
Image -based representation is another growing field that is powere d by advances in computer 
vision and image recognition in the last decade. In 2018, Zhavoronkov et al. constructed a 3D 
image representation of molecular structure based on wave transform and convolutional neural 
network. In 2019, Vogiatzis et al.  proposed  a persistence image (PI) representation based on the persistent homology mathematics, which provides a topological representation and has been 
applied to identify 44 new CO 2 binders based on an active learning model.183  
Another challenge is the scarcity of data. Even for properties that are relatively inexpensive 
and easy to determine, for example, p Ka, the size of the database is usually no more than a few 
thousand for a certain class of molecules. Other  properties , such as the  CO 2 binding constant or 
redox potential in a specific solvent , may be costlier or more demanding, leading to an even more 
severe lack of data. Automation does not help much since ML needs data points of different 
molecules using the same setting, and the rate -limiting factor of the whole workflo w is the 
commercial availability or synthesis of molecules, while most automation set -ups aim to optimize 
experimental parameters such as concentration, temperature, pressure, and choice of solvents. Data 
augmentation techniques, such as symmetry -based exp ansion or neural networks making use of 
non-uniqueness of SMILES,184 helps improving prediction -oriented models but does not make 
chemical space richer for generative tasks. A promising approac h is the jointly training over a 
combined dataset of experimental and ab initio  result to achieve data enrichment and to explore 
expanded chemical space.185  
A universal or generalized ML model for exploration of chemical space may not exist at all; 
even if there can be one, it may not work well. The difficulty originates in the intrinsic 
discontinuity of chemical s pace of practical molecules – they are deep wells scattering over the 
potential energy surface  separated by unstable structures – and the knowledge to avoid th e 
impractical regions must be provided by either ad hoc prior with chemical insights (encoding 
grammar, formatting, predefined chemical environment and fragments, ligand pool) or 
sufficiently large and reliable experimental dataset (which is not available) ; otherwise a myriad 
of disordered atomic clusters may dominate the set. Such sparse nature of chemical space also 
makes hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size) and convergence difficult, especially on 
a diverse dataset. The tradeoff between comp lete sampling of chemical space and producing 
practical molecules are somewhat contradictory. Despite the unsatisfactory transferability, 
generative ML models are still the best possible tools at the moment to locally explore the 
chemical space of a specif ic class of chemicals to optimize the desired property.  
4. Conclusion and Outlook  
Electrochemical  CO 2 capture and concentration  has significantly higher theoretical 
energetic efficienc ies compared to thermal methods. Although the field is still in its infancy, the few reported systems  using redox carriers have  thermodynamic efficiencies that rival or exceed 
current state -of-the-art amine -based capture systems.186–188 However, practical implementation  
require s improvements to the performance, stability, and efficiency of the redox carriers. The 
current systems perform at <10% of the theoretical efficienc y, but these values could  be improved 
by modifying the redox carrier CO 2 binding constant ( KCO2) and reduction potential  (E1/2). 
However, the reduction potential (E 1/2) is also a critical property towards redox carrier sensitivity 
towards O 2, while undesirable reactivity with water is dictated by its pKa. In this tutorial review, 
we discuss how these values are correlated  through scaling  relationships , leading to  undesirable 
trade -offs for the respective properties. We describe the use of experimental and computational 
methods to pursue design strategies for redox carriers that  deviate from these scaling relationships  
leading to more optimal properties .  
 
Box/Pane l 1 Experimentally Measuring CO 2 Binding Constants  
Determination of 𝐾CO2 for the active and resting states of redox carriers can be determined 
utilizing numerous methods. The use of electrochemical methods, however, are unique to redox 
carriers. Large carrier CO 2 binding constants ( 𝐾CO 2 > 100) can be measured using the observ ed 
shift in the reduction potential recorded in the presence ( 𝐸1/2′) and absence ( 𝐸1/2) of a known 
concentration of CO 2 by applying equation 7.83,89 
𝐸1/2′=𝐸1/2+𝑅𝑇
𝑛𝐹ln(𝐾CO2)+𝑞𝑅𝑇
𝑛𝐹ln [CO 2]                         7 
Where 𝑅 is the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol-1 K-1), 𝑇 is absolute temperature ( K), 𝐹 is 
the Faraday constant (96485 C mol-1), and 𝑛 is the number of electrons being passed in the redox 
event. The number of CO 2 molecules that are bound during the chemical step is represented by the 
term 𝑞 (typically, 𝑞 = 1 or 2, and can be determined via other spectroscopic or voltametric 
techniques ).66,67,189 For carriers where 𝐾CO2 < 100, the assumption that 𝐾CO2[CO 2] >> 1 (which is 
used to derive equation 7) is no longer valid, and equation 8 must be used instead, where 𝑞  is 
assumed to be 1.83 
𝐸1/2′=𝐸1/2+𝑅𝑇
𝑛𝐹ln(𝐾CO 2[CO 2]+1)                                                 8 
This approach can be highly beneficial, as it does not require isolation of the active state carrier, 
which can often be unstable or difficult to isolate cleanly. Furthermore, the approach can be utilized for carriers spanning a large range of 𝐾CO 2 (𝐾CO2 values ranging between <10 to >1015 
have been reported using this method)63,66 ,67,83. Values of 𝐾CO2 for redox -carriers can be also be 
determined using more common spectroscopic or physical techniques, depending on the 
magnitude of 𝐾CO2 and solubility of the carrier. These techniques include, but are not limited to: 
NMR and electronic absorption spectro scopy, gravimetry, and gas uptake experiments.66,67,84,85
