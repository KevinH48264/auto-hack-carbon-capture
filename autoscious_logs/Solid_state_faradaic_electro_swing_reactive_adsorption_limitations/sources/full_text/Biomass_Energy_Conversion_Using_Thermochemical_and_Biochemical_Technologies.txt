Sustainable and Clean Energy Production Technologies
Chapter
AbstractIncreasing oil prices, energy security and rising greenhouse gas concentrations necessitate the need for the development of biomass-based energy conversion technologies. Extensive lab-scale scientific studies have been performed on the conversion of various biomass feedstocks to energy in the form of electricity, heat and fuels/chemicals in solid, liquid and gases. The current review gives an overview of different thermal and biochemical technologies (incineration, gasification, pyrolysis, liquefaction, carbonization, cogeneration, anaerobic digestion, ethanol fermentation, transesterification, etc.) for bioenergy generation. The advantages and limitations of primary conversion technologies like thermochemical and biochemical conversion techniques have also been discussed here. Different type of biomass-based feedstocks, their pretreatment requirements, are reviewed. The health and environmental hazards of biomass energy conversion plants and their advantages over conventional fuel sources are discussed in detail. The review also discusses air pollution hazards related to different pollutants and diverse preventive measures taken to mitigate the problem. The current study also discusses the potential and limitations of biomass energy generation projects considering process economy, technological limitation, socio-political aspect and the role of government policies from the Indian context. The extended discussion on the aforementioned criteria further reaffirms the necessity of the current review.KeywordsBiomassBioenergyThermochemical-biochemical conversionBiogasEconomical aspectsIndia
