Abstract:  
 
Building a carbon -neutral world needs to remove the excess CO 2 that has already been 
dumped into the atmosphere. The sea, soil, vegetation, and rocks on Earth all naturally uptake CO 2 
from the atmosphere. Human beings can  accelerate these processes in specific ways. The review 
summarizes the present Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology that contribute to Negative 
Emissions. Research currently being done has suggested future perspectives and directions of 
various methods for  Negative Emission. New generations of technologies have emerged as a result 
of recent advancements in surface chemistry, material synthesis, and engineering design. These 
technologies may influence the large -scale deployment of existing CO 2 capture techno logies in the 
future.

 1. Introduction:  
 
The entire structure of creation depends heavily on carbon. It can be found as dissolved forms in 
the atmosphere, dead organic debris, fossil fuels, rocks, tissues of plants and animals, and the 
ocean. The concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere has increas ed by more than 100 ppm in the 
past 200 years. The disposed carbon dioxide (CO 2) from fossil fuels in the atmosphere is the main 
factor contributing to climate change1. Aggravated climate change increases the probability of 
severe ecological impacts2-4. Current total CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels approach 40 Gt/year5. 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported CO 2 emissions will rise from 
existing level of 49  GtCO 2eq/yr to between 85 and 136 GtCO 2eq/yr by 2050 without intervention6. 
The rising CO 2 concentration might raise the earth's average temperature from 3.8 to 6.0 °C by 
2100 compared to the pre -industrial level6. It will take some time for the energy infrastructure to 
transition from using fossil fuels to using renewable energ y sources. Utilizing localized CO 2 
capture and storage (CCS) systems, power stations and industrial producers might minimize CO 2 
emissions while burning fossil fuels7-10. However, lowering CO 2 emissions from solitary point 
sources will not be enough to rea ch the objective of keeping atmospheric CO 2 at 450 ppm and 
reaching carbon neutrality before 205011,12. This will necessitate the development of technology 
to directly capture and permanently remove CO 2 from ambient air13-19. Capturing CO 2 from the 
atmosph ere, referred as Direct Air Capture (DAC), has the potential to lessen or perhaps stop 
global warming20,21. 
Since the early report on evaluating the feasibility of Direct Air Capture system by American 
Physical Society in 201122, it is asserted that DAC is  already capable of capturing 1 percent of 
annual world CO 2 emissions23. The cost estimation of DAC has been reduced from the ranges of 
610 to 1100 $/ton CO 2 22,24 to 94 to 232 $/ton CO 225. Considering the thermodynamic system 
efficiencies and environmenta l impact of the technology, life cycle assessment (LCA) is an 
efficient multi -step process for evaluating the feasibility of large -scale DAC deployment26-40. 
Pielke41 calculated the cost of DAC as a percentage of global GDP to 2100 for CO 2 stabilization 
at 450 and 550 ppm. The cost of DAC is in the range between 0.3% and 3% of global GDP. The 
generated LCA results vary depending on the capture methods used, the energy sources used for 
system regeneration, and other factors like as climate and environmental consequences, air 4 
 pollution, and societal cost. Overall, the LCA analysis demonstrates the feasibility of using DAC 
as a climate -mitigation technique.  
Increasing number of policies passed or enacted in recent years supporting DAC industries in the 
U.S 42. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) launched Carbon Negative Earthshots in November 
2021 to accelerate the goal of net -zero emissions by 2050, hoping to deploy Carbon Dioxide 
Removal (CDR) at a gigaton scale. The Carbon Negative Earthshots is one of the fi rst U.S 
government’s major efforts in CDR to tackle the imminent climate crisis global society faces. The 
new targets aim to decrease the total cost of CDR to lower than $100 per ton by 2050. DOE will 
spend approximately $10 billion on new direct carbon ma nagement funding through the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Law. In addition, most recently passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 
2022 is expected to substantially increase the tax credits toward the operations that qualify under 
specific high stan dards for wage and workforce conditions: for example, $180/ton for sequestered 
CO 2 and $130/ton for capture -and-reuse systems43,44. Accordingly, strengthened climate goals 
with mandates and financial investment incentives are delivering unprecedented momen tum for 
DAC to be viable43. With federal support, we believe CCUS technologies will play an essential 
role in meeting net zero targets, including point source capture, which tackles emissions from 
heavy industry and direct capture to remove carbon from the  atmosphere45-47  
2. Technologies of Direct Air Capture of CO 2 
 
Direct Air Capture (DAC) is a technology -based solution for carbon capture. Lackner first 
introduced to capture CO 2 from the air, or DAC, to fight the climate change in 199948. Researchers 
argued Direct Air Capture of CO 2 is a necessary and practical way to reduce CO 2 concentration in 
the atmosphere 25,26,41,49 -76. IPCC claimed negative emission technologies, such as DAC,  is 
necessary to solve climate change issue77. The econo mic feasibility of DAC has also been 
established23,25,78 -83.  
A few companies pioneered this effort. Carbon Engineering25 uses a hydroxide solution to capture 
CO 2, and then heat sorbent to high temperatures to release CO 2 for storage. The business model 
relies on selling captured CO 2 to make new products. Climeworks84 based out of Switzerland uses 
amine sorbents in small modular reactors that cost more than Carbon Engineering, but the potential 5 
 savings down the road could be higher. The idea is that the mod ular design could make the process 
cheaper to produce when scaled up. It also requires lower temperatures during the regeneration 
process by using waste heat. A similar model is being followed by another company, Global 
Thermostat, which partners up with i ndustrial plants and uses their waste heat to capture CO 2 from 
the air and offsets the emissions from that plant. Verdox uses an electrochemical approach85 to 
capture CO 2 from industrial sources and the air. Carbon Collect employs mechanical trees to 
captu re and release CO 2 by controlling moisture59,86. Captured CO 2 by DAC technology can be 
utilized for various purposes in industry, such as enhanced oil recovery, beverage manufacturing, 
concrete curing, food transportation, etc.  
The most significant portio n of DAC technology is the advance of energy -saving materials to 
capture and release CO 2. Currently, there are seven types of DAC technologies, including physical 
sorption87-94, strong bases sorption49,51,87,95 -101, amine -functional materials9,102 -110, ami no acid 
solution and guanidine compound111-119, moisture -swing sorption14,59,86,120 -133, and electrochemical 
sorption85. The six typical technologies for DAC are shown in Figure 1.

 Figure 1. Six standard technologies for Direct Air Capture of CO 2 (DAC).  
2.1 Physisorption  Materials:  
Van der Waals or ion quadrupole forces determine the performance of CO 2 capture by 
physisorption88. Physisorption requires a considerably low energy of regeneration less than 60 
kJ/mol compared to chemisorption above 70 kJ/mol134, shown in Figure 2. The regeneration 
process Physisorption is convenient and sustainable. However, the competitive physisorption by 
H2O in the air may jeopardize the capacity of sorbents.  A material with a high surface -to-volume 
ratio is required for p hysisorption of CO 289-91. Potential candidates include metal -organic 
frameworks (MOFs), zeolites, alumina, nanostructured graphite, and so on87,135,136. 
 
Figure 2.  Heat of adsorption -CO 2 uptake (at 1000 ppm for 1 day).134 
Madden et al. 135,136 studied the  CO 2 sorption capacities of different porous materials, including 
zeolite, amine -impregnated SBA -15, and MOFs, as shown in Figure 3. The study claims that water 
in the atmosphere can significantly reduce their CO 2 capture performance, due to the competitiv e 
sorption and the stability issue of MOFs in a moisture condition.  
7 
  
Figure 3. Molecular structures of MOFs used as CO 2 sorbents by physisorption136 
Mukherjee et al.137 summarized the CO 2 capacity and kinetics of six types of MOFs under low 
concentration of CO 2 with dry air or wet air (74% relative humidity). NbOFFIVE -1-Ni and 
TIFSIX -3-Ni show the highest CO 2 capacity of 1.3 mmol/g and 1.2 mmol/g under 500 ppm of CO 2 
in the dry air conditi on, respectively. The reason is the adjustment of pore size can significantly 
affect the performance of CO 2 sorption by MOFs materials. Figure 4  shows humidity decreases 
CO 2 capacity and kinetics of the five sorbents. Authors also studied the decrease of CO 2 capacity 
from 2 -10% over six consecutive sorption -desorption cycles.

in the dry and wet conditions. (a) CO 2 capacity of five sorbents. (b) CO 2 retention time.  
2.2 Strong -base Materials:  
CO 2 chemisorption is different from physisorption because of the bond break and formation 
between the CO 2 and sorbent materials. CO 2 can be easily removed from the air by metal 
hydroxides or alkaline salts, and then converted to metal carbonates during chemisorption49,51,87,95 -
100,138 -141. A calcination procedure can then be employed to regenerate the sorbent and produce a 
concentrated  stream of CO 2.142,143. However, the calcination process is energy -intensive requiring 
high temperatures input. Keith et al. 25 reported the energy consumption of the process chemistry 
and thermodynamics used in Carbon Engineering, shown in Figure 5. Overc oming the high energy 
consumption and heat losses during heating materials are challenging to prevent144-146, which 
makes the strong -base materials for CO 2 capture from air technically and economically difficult.

2.3 Amine -functional Materials:  
The most popular way to prepare solid amine -functional sorbents include (1) impregnating amines 
in porous materials. Polyethylenimine (PEI) was first loaded into a mesoporous molecular sieve 
as a CO 2 sorbent in 2002147. In the following decades, researchers impregnated amines into 
different porous materials, such as alumina, silica, zeolites, nanostructured graphite, black carbon, 
MOFs, COFs, and so on147-166 (2) Adding the amine group chemically to the substrate sur face167-
172. Youssef Belmabkhout et al.167 were the first to suggest using triamine -grafted mesoporous 
silica, TRI -PE-MCM -41, to capture CO 2 from the air. According to Mattew E. Potter et al.173,  
Because alumina supports are more resistant to moisture and  air than silica supports are, they may 
provide possible stability benefits over porous silica. (3) Amine tethering and ligand 
modification167-172,174 -177. The above three methods are shown in Figure 6.  
10

Two types of amine -functionalized MIL -101(Cr) were explored by Darunte et al.178 : MIL -
101(Cr) -TREN and MIL -101(Cr) -PEI-800. In this study, a small polyamine with high primary 
amines density, tris (2 -amino ethyl) (TREN), was loaded to MIL -101(Cr) via both grafting and 
impregnation, and a large branched poly(ethylene imine) (PEI -800) w as loaded into the MIL -
101(Cr) MOF via physical impregnation method. What they found was that the grafted MIL -
101(Cr) -TREN only had 0.35 mmol/g MOF and impregnated MIL -101(Cr) -TREN had a 
significant capacity loss from a cyclic test due to the high volatili ty of TREN under Direct Air 
Capture condition coupled with temperature swing adsorption. Unlike a small polyamine TREN, 
PEI-loaded MIL -101(Cr) improved cyclic stability attributed to the lower volatility. The effect of 
PEI loading was also investigated in this study. Although the amine efficiencies were enhanced as 
amine loading increased, 85 wt% of PEI loading was found to be optimal considering the trade -
offs between capture capacity and kinetics.  
 
11 
 Zhu et al.  179 have also functionalized Mg -Al mixed metal  oxides with branched PEI via the 
physical impregnation method. They found that using mixed metal oxides (MMOs) increased the 
mesopores of the materials formed from the exfoliated nanosheets and the calcination process. The 
authors observed that the PEI -loaded MMOs slightly increased in CO 2 uptake when they 
underwent desorption above 200 °C, while PEI -loaded SBA -15 had a rapid decrease, which is a 
commonly faced problem of class 1 adsorbents. This study’s optimal loading of PEI was 67 wt% 
before the PEI cov ered the MMO nanosheets. The authors argue that the optimized CO 2 diffusion 
channel and increased surface area led to improved kinetics, resulting in a higher CO 2 uptake of 
PEI67/Mg 0.55Al-O. Moreover, the facilitated electrostatic attraction between the un iformly 
dispersed impregnated PEI and MMO layers led to the thermal robustness of PEI67/Mg 0.55Al-O 
composites as well as the accessibility of the CO 2 molecules.  
Nanoparticle organic hybrid materials (NOHMs) are a new type of self -suspended nanoparticle 
system180,181. Park’s group firstly explored the solvating properties of NOHMs for CO 2 capture182, 
and synthesized five different NOHMs using silica nanoparticles as cores grafted by amines183 in 
2011, following extensive characterization experiment to under stand the properties and thermal 
stability of the material184-188. Rim  et al.189 successfully encapsulated optimal loading of 49 wt% 
the highly viscous liquid -like NOHMs as microdroplets size into highly gas permeable polymer, 
TEGO Rad 2650. They observed approximately 50 times enhanced capture kinetics compared to 
the bulk NOHMs under 1 atm CO 2. The performance of the optimal encapsulated NOHMs under 
Direct Air Capture condition was 0.88 mmol CO 2/g sorbent in 1 h. However, there still remains a 
challenge t o reach the Department of Energy’s target kinetics of 1 mmol CO 2/g sorbent in 1 h.  
2.4 Amino Acid and Guanidine Sorbents:  
Custelcean et al.111-119,190,191 describe a method for DAC that relies primarily on amino acid 
solution and guanidine compound materia ls. First, aqueous amino acid solutions that are widely 
accessible are used for CO 2 sorption. Following that, guanidine compound is used to react with 
CO 2-loaded solution, and the resulting crystallization of an extremely insoluble carbonate salt 
regenerat es the amino acid sorbent. Finally, relatively mild heating of the carbonate crystals results 
in effective CO 2 release and regeneration of the guanidine compound. The process is shown in 
Figure 7.  12 
  
Figure 7. CO 2 capture from ambient air using glycine and  guanidine116. 
The kinetics of crystallization, particle size distribution, and crystal habit are only a few of the 
many factors that must be adjusted to optimize the DAC technology.  
2.5 Moisture -swing CO 2 Sorbent:  
Lackner59 advocated employing moisture -swing sorbents to capture CO 2 from ambient air with 
lower energy cost compared with amine method. Water is essential in the CO 2 sorption -desorption 
process122,129,192. Moisture -swing CO 2 sorbent uptakes CO 2 in dry environments  and release it in 
moisture. The sorbent is an anion -exchange resin that has carbonate ions and quaternary 
ammonium cations permanently attached to polystyrene. Shi et al.  86 elucidated the sorption and 
desorption mechanisms. Other sorbents for the DAC app roach were created by impregnating 
carbon black with an amine -containing polymer193-195, developed from a biomass material123, 
prepared by bamboo cellulose127.  
Armstrong131 investigated the availability and kinetic uptake of CO 2 in sorbents encased in 
different matrices. A commercially available industrial film containing ion -exchange resin (IER), 
IER particles embedded in dense electrospun fibers, and IER particles embedded in porous 
electrospun fibers are compared using a solvothermal polymer additive re moval technique to 
create porosity in the porous fibers. The experimental results indicate that electrospinning 
polymer/sorbent composites is a promising technology for improving the handleability of sorbent 
particles and the sorption kinetics, with the IE R embedded in porous electrospun fibers 
demonstrating the highest cycle capacity with an uptake rate of 1.4 mol of CO 2 per gram -hour, 
shown in Figure 8.

during direct air capture.  
Shi et al. recently reported on the effects of sorbent parameters on CO 2 capture efficiency, which 
may pave the way for future moisture swing technology -based optimization of various materials 
for DAC, shown in Figure 9 86. Moisture swing performance is weather dependent, and it works 
best in hot, dry environments.

 2.6 Electrochemical Sorbent:  
The creation of innovative, cost - and energy -efficient solutions is still a top focus for DAC 
research.  Recently, interest in electrochemical CO 2 capture has increased due to the fact that it 
does not require heat energy to release CO 2196-198. Several elec trochemical -swing reactive sorption 
systems were recently published in Hatton’s group85,199 -201. Voskian et al. firstly demonstrated a 
solid -state electro -swing reactive adsorption system that uses an electrochemical cell to absorb 
carbon dioxide through t he reductive addition of CO 2 to quinones85. Then, an electrochemically 
mediated DAC system composed by stackable bipolar cells is described that relies solely on the 
electrochemical voltage for CO 2 capture and release by quinone chemistry199. The energy 
consumption was reported as low as 113 kJ/mol of CO 2 captured. Diederichsen et al.200 further 
advanced the method of electrochemically mediated carbon capture with high -concentration liquid 
quinone chemistry in a continuous two -cell flow system. The system i s shown in Figure 10.  
In a whole bench scale process, the device managed to gather and release CO 2 continuously while 
maintaining high electrochemical stability. The electrochemical process can be further optimized 
by the electrode and electrolyte chemist ry. The stability of quinones during air oxidation and 
Faradaic efficiency during the capture condition of 400 ppm CO 2 can be further improved in future 
studies. Further research into electrochemically capturing CO 2 directly from the air is required.

and physisorption.  
3. The Importance of the Stability of CO 2 Sorbent  
 
The development of a new class of thermally stable CO 2 capture materials is one o f the main 
hurdles to efficient CO 2 collecting. Lackner’s group14,81,82,202 provided a techno -economic model 
consisting of a net -present value equation to determine the maximum affordable budget (MAB) of 
a sorbent for any DAC system based on factors that are well recognized. The MAB assessment of 
existing DAC sorbents used in pre vious research suggests that the high capacity, short cycle 
duration, and strong resistance to degradation of each sorbent are the three most important aspects 
for the economic viability of DAC systems. As new DAC sorbents are the primary focus of current 
research, it is strongly suggested that the stability of DAC sorbents be investigated. Table shows 
that for a lifetime of 100,000 cycles, MOF (Diamine) has the highest allowable budget of $180/kg 
because of high capacity and short loading time. Unfortunate ly, MOFs are among the most 
expensive sorbents with prices as high as $10,000/kg to $15,000/kg (and it actually cannot be used 
for 100,000 cycles). For a lifetime of 100,000 cycles, Ion Exchange Resin (IER) or chitosan has 
the allowable budget of $80 -100/k g. The price is about $1 -10/kg for IER and <$10 -20/kg for 
chitosan. From the perspective of cost, the study expounds the importance of the stability of 
sorbents for the industrialization of DAC.

Table: Sorbent budgets for lifetimes of 1,000, 50,000 and 100,000 cycles. The value of the sorbent 
(or the maximum allowed Budget is calculated based on the model described in the main text. In 
the evaluation, a discount rate r = 5%, and P CO2 = $50/t CO 2 have been assumed. The table is 
adjusted from Ref.14. *𝑡𝑐𝑦𝑐𝑙𝑒 1/2, the time for half -loading the sorbent, is used as the cycle duration 
(𝑡cycle) in the model and desorption is assumed to be virtually instant. For consistency we also 
used 𝐶1/2, which is half of the nominal capacity. **For an upper -bound sorbent budget the lowest 
value among the available data was used.  
Amine sorbents own gre at capacity, but have degradation issues during the regeneration process 
under high temperature. The tiny, liquid amino molecules monoethanolamine (MEA), 
diethanolamine (DEA), and diisopropylamine (DIPA) have severe stability issues, due to their low 
boiling temperatures and high volatility148. Although PEIs with extremely large molecular weights 
(number -average molecular weights (Mn) tested up to 750 000) are relatively robust during CO 2 
capture at high temperatures and in a vacuum, these structures do not  support fast CO 2 diffusion 
into and out of the matrix. PEI with a high molecular weight might clog pores109.  
Pang et al.  203showed the use of linear poly(propylenimine) (PPI) supported in silica as a sorbent 
for CO 2 removal from air. PPI -based sorbents f or DAC are more effective than PEI -based sorbents 
because PPI is more resistant to oxidative degradation than PEI and therefore has a longer sorbent 
working life. Pang et al . 204examined the tradeoff between sorption capacity and sorption -site 
accessibilit y across a variety of CO 2 collection circumstances. In comparison to linear PEI, linear 
PPI/SBA -15 composites preserved 65 –83 percent of their CO 2 capacity following oxidative 
treatment, whereas linear PEI retained just 20 –40 percent. In addition, the scie ntists proved the 
stability of linear PPI sorbents during 50 sorption/desorption cycles without any performance 
degradation. By incorporating a branching polyethylenimine (PEI) into a porous cross -linked 
poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) support, other researchers  improved the material's resilience to 
degradation205. 18 
 Wurzbacher et al.168 first developed a cyclic temperature -vacuum swing (TVS) technique for 
separating CO2 from ambient air using a Class 2 sorbent. The cycle may function in both dry and 
moist air. In a solvent -free process, amine was grafted onto silica gel beads of 2 –5 mm in diameter. 
After heating the sorbent material to temperatures ranging from 74 to 90 °C at a pressure of 150 
mbar, the CO 2 taken from air with a relative humidity of 40% could be re covered. The sorbent 
exhibited outstanding stability through forty consecutive sorption/desorption cycles, with a cyclic 
CO 2 capture capacity of 0.8 mmol/g under dry circumstances and a regeneration chamber pressure 
of 200 mbar. Gebald et al. 169,206discov ered a new amine -based nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC)207 
sorbent. Over 100 consecutive cycles, the equilibrium CO 2 sorption capacity decreased by less 
than 5%, demonstrating the material's excellent stability.  
Liquid -like nanoparticle organic hybrid mate rials (NOHMs) have demonstrated a high thermal 
stability. They are created by covalently or ionically grafting polymeric amine chains onto 
inorganic silica nanoparticles183,208. In-depth characterization studies have been carried out by 
Park's group to com prehend the material's characteristics and thermal stability184-188. This increase 
in oxidative thermal stability is attributable to the greater viscosity of the liquid -like NOHMs 
compared to the untethered polymer, and the bond stabilization of the ionica lly tethered polymer 
in the NOHM canopy188. Authors claimed that, due to their superior oxidative thermal stability, 
NOHMs can be used as functional materials for sustainable energy storage applications. To 
improve the highly viscous liquid -like bulk phase  of NOHMs, Park’s group developed hybrid CO 2 
capture materials, solvent impregnated polymers (SIPs), that can enhance CO 2 capture kinetics 
and stability189,209. The incorporation and UV curing of liquid -like nanoparticle organic hybrid 
materials functional ized with polyethylenimine (NOHM -I-PEI) into a shell material yields gas -
permeable solid sorbents with uniform NOHMs loading (NPEI -SIPs). Figure 12 shows the stability 
of SIPs over 20 consecutive CO 2 capture and release temperature swing cycles (50 ℃ to 100 ℃ 
or120 ℃). At 100 and 120 °C, NPEI -SIP particles were sustained through 20 cycles with just a 
2.6% loss.  19 
  
Figure 12. Over 20 CO 2 capture and sorbent regeneration cycles, the recyclability of NPEI -SIPs 
loaded with 49 wt% NOHM -I-PEI and PEI -SIP loaded with 49 wt% PEI was determined. In the 
CO2 capture stage at 50 °C, 0.15 atm dry CO2 balanced with N2 was employed, and the SIPs were 
regenerated under 1 atm N2 at 100 or 120 °C.  
Still, there is a pauci ty of information in the literature on sorbent cycle length, stability, and 
lifespan. According to the available statistics, capacity reductions usually occur after less than 10 
consecutive cycles. Our investigation reveals that air capture sorbents must g o through tens of 
thousands of cycles81. Therefore, sorbent stability needs to be increased significantly.  
4. Electrified Heating Technology for Sorbent Regeneration  
It is feasible to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the development an d 
implementation of electric industrial process heating systems210. A key advantage of electrified 
heating technology is the capacity to aim energy more accurately and, as a result, lower the total 
heat necessary to achieve the desired material or chemical  change. Electrified heating technologies 
include resistive heating, induction heating, electromagnetic radiative heating, UV induced 
transformations, infrared heating, electron beam, plasma heating and transformations, etc. The 
regeneration procedure of C O2 sorbent is necessary after it is fully loaded. The endothermic 
process of CO 2 desorption requires a high temperature of around 80 to 130 ℃. Electrified heating 
20 
 technologies can be an alternative more efficient heating process compared to the combustion of 
fossil fuels.  
4.1 Microwave Heating  
Recently, the notion of employing microwave heating as an alternate method has been proposed 
for the regeneration of CO 2 sorbent. The effectiveness of MW irradiation depends on the MW 
energy's capacity to be absorbed  by molecules having a dipole moment and transformed into 
heat211, shown in Figure 13.  
 
Figure 13. Approaches to heating: conductive heating and microwave heating.  
The dielectric constant and dielectric loss factor are two important variables related to the MW 
method. A substance's capacity to retain energy is measured by its dielectric constant, and its 
capacity to transform electromagnetic energy into heat is calcu lated using its dielectric loss 
factor212,213. These two constants depend on the temperature, molecular interactions, and MW 
frequency in the solution214. MW has a reputation for being an instantaneous, volumetric heating 
process with an infinite capacity for heat transmission.  
In comparison to traditional thermal desorption, Chronopoulus et al .215 found that MW might 
potentially provide the option of an overall CO 2 desorption process that is four times faster. The 
MW for the regeneration process of amino -functionalized materials has also been observed 
approximately four times faster than conventional heating216,217. A research on the direct and 
indirect effects of microwaves on the Na -ETS-10 solvent was undertaken by Chudburry et al.218. 
21 
 After five cycles of CO 2 desorption, authors discovered that direct microwave regeneration 
produced a 22% greater desorption capacity and used 16.6% less energy than indirect microwave 
heating. McGurk stated that the MW could rapidly regenerate the MEA a t low temperatures, which 
is about 70 –90 °C, compared to the conventional thermal regeneration at high temperatures, 120 –
140 °C, which leads to the overall cost reduction. According to McGurk et al.219, the MW could 
regenerate the MEA quickly at low temper atures around 70 -90 °C, as opposed to the traditional 
thermal regeneration at high temperatures roughly 120 -140 °C, which results in an overall cost 
savings. . Furthermore, Ji et al.220 recently reported their work on microwave -assisted regeneration 
on a s lurry of basic immobilized amine sorbent (BIAS) with 10 times accelerated CO 2 desorption 
and 48% lower electricity consumption compared to conventional thermal heating method, which 
authors argue was attributed to selective heating and increased polarity C O2-adsorbed BIAS 
sorbents.  
4.2 Induction Heating  
Based on the well -known Néel and Brownian relaxation process, magnetic materials may produce 
heat on their own by converting electromagnetic energy into thermal heat when placed in an 
alternating magnetic f ield221,222. In an alternating magnetic field, Hill's group223 employed a 
magnetic metal -organic framework (MOF) adsorbent to quickly release the adsorbed CO 2 by 
rapidly raising the temperature inside the magnetic adsorbent. When an alternating magnetic fi eld 
is applied to a MOF mother liquid containing carboxylic acid -decorated MNPs, each MNP 
"nanoheater" generates heat locally, resulting in a solvothermal microenvironment (Figure 14). 
Furthermore, the MNPs serve as a nucleation surface for MOF development . It was therefore 
suggested to use a method known as magnetic induction swing adsorption (MISA). They then 
achieved quick CO 2 desorption at the magnetic field with energy efficiency of no more than 60% 
by using magnetic MgFe2O4@UiO -66224. 22 
  
Figure 14. Dia gram illustrating MOF development in a MIFS method, as well as crystal structures 
of MOFs synthesized with MIFS.  
By synthesizing magnetic nanoparticles on NPC support, Lin et al.225 created Fe3O4/nitrogen -
doped porous carbon (NPC) sorbents. In the meantime , a CO 2-TSA in situ electromagnetic 
induction heating (EMIH) device was developed to assess the performance of the CO 2-TSA in situ 
electromagnetic induction heating (Figure 15) and to further shed light on the connection between 
CO 2 desorption rate and ene rgy effectiveness. The best adsorbent was determined to be 
Fe3O4/NPC -15, which had a CO 2 capacity of 2.64 mmol g -1 and saturation magnetization of 15.51 
emu g -1. Upon optimization, the fixed target temperature heating mode at 110 °C exhibited the 
best rege neration performance with the desorption rate of 3.27 mg g –1 s–1 and the energy 
efficiency of 79.2%, which are not only superior to those of the reported MISA technology but 
also considerably more efficient than the typical convective -heat-transfer TSA per formance. 
Researchers also utilized EMIH for CO 2 desorption on the sorbents of 13X zeolite and Fe 3O4226, 
as well as Fe 3O4@HKUST -1227.   
23

CO 2 capture (EMIH -CO 2-TSA).  
4.3 Plasma -assisted CO 2 desorption  
Plasma technology is another non -thermal method explored to regenerate CO 2 capture materials. 
According to Li  et al.  228, plasma was used to control the desorption process instantly. Turning on 
plasma ignition induced th e desorption of CO 2 from the hydrotalcite surface soon after, and as the 
plasma was switched off, the desorption process stopped immediately. At the same time, the 
plasma treatment also split CO 2 and achieved an average conversion of 41.14% to CO. Authors 
utilized the plasma technology to merge both desorption of CO 2 and conversion and claimed that 
the technology could reduce the cost and complexity of the DAC. However, according to this 
research, a considerable improvement in energy efficiency must be made  for plasma -assisted CO 2 
capture and conversion to be applicable.  
 
24 
 Figure 16. Non -thermal plasma induced CO 2 reduction via photovoltaic energy.  
 
Figure 17. Schematic diagram of syngas production via Direct Air Capture of CO 2 and 
conversion by plasma.  
Pou et al.  229 explain ed that non -thermal plasma produced with the photovoltaic system could  
generate the optimum electron energy to break the chemical bonds at room temperature and under 
atmospheric pressure, which makes the desorption process more energy efficient than thermal 
methods. They calculated the CO 2 emissions compensated value using photovoltaic electricity to 
be 67% higher than that of using an electricity mix, proving that coupling non -thermal plasma with 
a photovoltaic system considerably boosts sustainability.  
5. Sub -ambient Temperature Surrounding for DAC  
To maximize the effectiveness of DAC processes, it is crucial to understand how well DAC 
materials absorb CO 2 in actual operating co nditions. Unfortunately, little is known about capture 
effectiveness of these materials at various operating temperatures.   The investigation of sorbent 
performance was limited to temperatures that were both ambient and above ambient (20 °C).  
Due to the fa ct that more than 80% of the world's land has an annual average temperature below 
25 °C, research on DAC under sub -ambient settings has the ability to enhance DAC technology 
development and the possibility for general deployment on a global scale (Figure 1 8) 
25 
  
Figure 18. Map of world average temperature (°C)  
At sub -ambient temperatures (particularly 0 °C), it is anticipated that the physical and chemical 
properties of many CO2 sorbents will undergo substantial modifications. Therefore, sorbents 
optimized fo r ambient DAC must be reevaluated and, in many instances, modified in order to attain 
optimal performance at sub -ambient circumstances. DAC may provide some benefits in sub -
ambient temperature circumstances. The energy required to desorb water across tempe rature or 
temperature -vacuum swing adsorption cycles may be limited by the lower absolute humidity at 
colder temperatures. Additionally, the use of physisorbents rather than chemisorbents may be 
made possible by freezing temperatures.  
Miao et al.230 studie d how the DAC performance of the polyamine -loaded mesoporous silica was 
affected by operating temperatures. Researchers found that at lower adsorption temperatures below 
15 °C, the CO 2 adsorption selectivity of polyethylenimine -loaded mesoporous silica red uces. The 
ideal desorption temperatures, which range from 90 to 120 °C, as well as the adsorption kinetics 
and long -term stability were also parametrically examined by the authors.  Figure 19 shows that 
the optimal adsorption temperatures for 50% PEI/SBA -15 working at simulated atmospheric 
conditions are 45  ℃. CO 2 capture kinetics reduces with the decrease of temperature from 45  ℃. 
26 
  
Figure 19. Comparison of the capacity of 50% PEI/SBA -15 at different adsorption temperatures.  
According to Rim et al.231, amine -impregnated MIL -101(Cr) materials (PEI, poly(ethylenimine), 
or TEPA, tetraethylenepentamine), provide promising adsorption and desorption behavior under 
DAC circumstances in both the presence and absence of humidity throughout a wide range of 
tempe ratures (20 to 25 °C). The sorbents exhibit varying CO 2 capture behavior depending on the 
amine loading and adsorption temperature. The sorbents exhibit weak and robust chemisorption -
dominant CO 2 capture behaviors, respectively, with amine loadings of 30 a nd 50 weight percent. 
Interestingly, due to enhanced weak chemisorption at 20 °C, the CO 2 adsorption capacity of 30 
wt% TEPA -impregnated MIL -101(Cr) rose noticeably from 0.39 mmol/g at ambient conditions 
(25 °C) to 1.12 mmol/g. The sorbents also demonstrat e promising working capacity (0.72 mmol/g) 
across 15 cycles of minor temperature swings with extremely low regeneration temperatures 
(20 °C sorption to 25 °C desorption). Under humid conditions, the sorbents' sub -ambient DAC 
performance is improved even mo re, displaying promising and steady CO 2 working capabilities 
over several humid small temperature swing cycles. These findings show that properly engineered 
DAC sorbents are capable of mild chemisorption at low temperatures, even in the presence of 
humidit y. By using the modest temperature changes made possible by this weak chemisorption 
behavior, significant energy savings may be achieved. According to this research, further studies 
are needed on DAC materials that can function at low, sub -ambient temperat ures in preparation 
for potential deployment in temperate and polar climes.

25 °C desorption).  
6. Computational Modeling  
 
Computational approaches are importa nt and complementary adjunct to experiments for the 
purpose of comprehending the processes of sorbent -CO 2 reactions, developing carbon capture 
agents with acceptable costs and toxicity, as well as designing Direct Air Capture processes. 
Quantum chemistry ( QC) may accurately and efficiently predict electronic and structural features, 
including reaction energetics and free energies of reaction, transition state energies, and structures 
of reaction species232-239. Classical molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Ca rlo (MC) modeling 
employing molecular mechanics force fields also serve a crucial role in relating experimental data 
of macroscopic scale processes to the molecular level. For instance, they can develop a 
fundamental understanding of the impact of solute –solvent interactions and the specifics of 
reaction dynamics, transport behavior (e.g., diffusivity, viscosity, and mass transfer) and other 
physicochemical phenomena on the performance of solution CO 2 capture and release240-247. The 
thriving machine learnin g (ML) has demonstrated considerable potential for expediting the 
development of porous materials for carbon capture248,249.  Multiphysics modeling coupled with 
fluid dynamics, heat and mass transfer, and chemical reaction may successfully design a CO 2 
capture filter and estimate the performance of a scaled -up carbon capture system with a specified 
degree of confidence250-252. The combination between chemical engineering experiments and 
computational modeling can give an efficient and cost -effective met hod of interpreting data at the 
28 
 pilot-plant scale, thereby leading research into process alternatives and optimizing the deployment 
of a plant.  
6.1 Mechanism Study Based on Quantum Chemistry  
Two alternative sorption processes are found for Amine -functional  sorbents: 1) Under dry 
circumstances, primary and secondary amines combine with CO 2 to produce carbamate or 
carbamic acid. 2) Amines react with CO 2 in the presence of moisture to create bicarbonate. 
However, the processes of CO 2 sorption remain unknown, a nd various groups typically ascribe 
conflicting infrared bands to bicarbonate. This raises questions about the presence of bicarbonate.  
da Silva et al.235,236 pioneered the mechanism study of amine sorbents by atomistic modeling. They 
employed ab initio ca lculations to determine the most likely process of carbamate production in 
alkanolamines interacting with CO 2. A zwitterion intermediate with a considerable lifespan in the 
system appears implausible. The experimental findings appear to be in excellent acc ord with a 
single -step process. Using the coordinate driving method, a series of computations were carried 
out in which the response coordinate was systematically modified while the other geometric 
parameters were optimized. There was no intrinsic energy b arrier in the subsequent proton transfer 
from the zwitterion to another MEA molecule to create carbamate. The zwitterion was not a local 
minimum in the gas phase, but it became one when solvent was added. The study demonstrated 
that the factor of solvent w as crucial for the stability of zwitterions. Therefore, the solvent impact 
must be meticulously accounted for while analyzing the CO 2 and amine interaction.  
The study result from Arstad et al.237 is in contrast to those from da Silva et al.235,236 and Shim  et 
al.238 which reveal that there is no reaction energy barrier in the proton abstraction mechanism that 
forms carbamate. By combining DFT calculations for geometry optimization and energy 
corrections for electron correlation, the quantum description of m olecules in the gas phase was 
achieved237. Arstad et al.  postulated a two -step process based on an intermediate carbamic acid. 
Additional water or amine molecules moved a proton from the nitrogen atom of the amine to a 
terminal CO2 group in the zwitterioni c encounter complex RNH 2+CO 2-, according to their 
calculations. As indicated in Figure 21, at the G3MP2B3 level of theory, the energy barrier for the 
proton migration mechanism from the zwitterion to the direct catalyst MEA was 9.3 kcal/mol. 
Recent DFT cal culations suspect the existence of zwitterions on solid amines again233. In order to 
clarify the optimal CO 2 adsorption method and deactivation process, Buijs et al.253-256 carried out 29 
 a series of atomistic modeling investigations. They proposed that amine  or amine -H2O catalyzed 
reactions are the main mechanisms through which carbamic acid mostly formed in the presence of 
CO 2 and H 2O. 
 
Figure 21. Structures and relative energies to the start complex of the reaction between CO 2, 
monoethanolamine (MEA) catalyzed by another MEA, and water.  
Shi et al.129 demonstrate, by means of quantum modeling, a sequence of unorthodox chemical 
processes in which the degree of hydrolysis of basic salts containing multiple water molecules is 
marke dly different from that in bulk water and can be controlled by adjusting the relative water 
content. Figure 22 shows the free energy change of the reaction between basic salts and different 
number of water molecules. This discovery has been applied to the design of efficient absorbents 
for CO 2 capture by controlling the amount of water molecules.

6.2 Mechanism Study Based on Molecul ar Dynamics  
To appreciate reaction processes and the behavior of CO 2 and sorbents, it is vital to comprehend 
the structure of participant molecules and the interactions that occur in both dynamic and 
equilibrium phases. These functionalities can be clarifi ed using the MD molecular simulation 
approaches. While abundant experimental data on CO 2 capture, it remains difficult to model these 
systems effectively enough to recreate, for example, temperatures of reaction that are consistent 
with experimental result s257,258. To study liquid -solid -CO 2 systems, sophisticated molecular 
simulation techniques have been developed. Incorporating density functional theory (DFT) into 
molecular dynamics is one example259. 
A methodology combining MD and DFT, shown in Figure 23,  was utilized by Shi et al.192,260 to 
calculate energy states connecting aqueous states to ionic states in the vacuum during CO 2 capture 
and release process. The following studies analyzed the effects of parameters of sorbents on CO 2 
capture efficiency and  lead the way toward the optimization of sorbents for DAC86,132. 
31 
  
Figure 23. Thermodynamic cycle for calculating reaction energy change with water numbers.  
Iida et al.261,262  investigated the effect of solvent water on the formation of amine -CO 2 bonds using 
RISM -SCF-SDD263,264, a hybrid technique combining QC for the solute and statistical mechanics 
for the solvent. It is acknowledged as a substitute for the QM/MM approach. They found that the 
barrier to reaction and the stability of the transiti on state in aqueous solution depended on an 
interaction between the hydration and dehydration of O and N. There was a single minimum at a 
reaction coordinate distance of 3.0 with no barrier present in the gas phase. In good agreement 
with the experiment, a  stable structure was observed in aqueous solution at a reaction coordinate 
distance of 1.6, with a transition state at 2.0 and an activation enthalpy of 9.3 kcal/mol, after the 
formation of identical intermediates in the gas phase.  
Sumon et al.246 investi gated the suggested zwitterion, termolecular, and carbamic acid processes 
using the semicontinuum (cluster plus continuum) solvation model while considering proton 
relays. They intended to remedy the poor stability forecast of aqueous carbamates that has p ersisted 
for decades. The chemical pathways for a single Monoethanol -amine (MEA) and two MEAs were 
computed using a solvation model with varying quantities of water molecules. The simulations of 
the single MEA route utilized different number of water molec ules. The two MEA models were 
investigated not only because the abstracting base in the proposed mechanisms could be a second 
MEA molecule, but also because CO 2 capture experiments demonstrate that the proton released 
by the zwitterion (even if released in itially to a bulk water molecule) migrates rapidly to a second 
MEA molecule, inhibiting the decomposition of carbamate back to CO 2 + MEA. For accurate 
32 
 modeling of chemical pathways, it has been demonstrated that the insertion of numerous explicit 
water mol ecules is essential.  
6.3 Discovery of materials for carbon capture by machine learning  
The thriving field of machine learning (ML) has been brought to several fields of materials 
science265-268, which has demonstrated considerable potential for expediting the development of 
materials for carbon capture269. Farmahini and coworkers248 have provided a summary of the 
recent development of multiscale and performance -based screening workflows for use in post -
combustion carbon capture. Yan et al.249 demonstrated h ow ML has been utilized to enhance the 
carbon capture, transport, usage, and storage value chain and made recommendations for further 
research.  
Dai’s group trained deep neural networks (DNNs) to estimate the CO 2 adsorption capacity using 
textural paramete rs as input features, including specific surface area, micropore volume, and 
mesopore volume270,271. First, it was discovered that only when three textural characteristics are 
employed for model training is the highest output prediction accuracy attained. In order to retrain 
the model, temperature (T) and pressure (P) were added to the input characteristics. They 
discovered that when pressure rose, the contribution from the mesopore increased, which is 
consistent with other studies272. 
 
Figure 24. The pred iction of CO 2 sorption of porous materials.  
Application of machine learning in MOFs for carbon capture seeks to develop structure –
performance connections and pick the most accurate descriptors for predicting the CO 2 adsorption 
capacity, working capacity, and selectivity273-278. Woo et al.274 created a quick and precise ML 
33 
 model for screening MOFs with increased CO 2 adsorption capability. Later, they increased the 
prediction accuracy rate, identifying 994 of the top 1000 MOFs from a test set of 70,000 MOFs275. 
Boyd et al.  273 designed and prepared MOFs with high CO 2 adsorption capability for wet flue gas 
using a data -driven methodology. They discovered that MOFs with parallel aromatic rings had 
almost optimal interactions with CO 2 and a low Henry coefficient for water. The CO 2/N2 selectivity 
investigation revealed that the pore structure of MOFs contributed to a high CO 2 uptake at high 
relative humidity by preventing the formation of hydrogen bonds.  
7. Dual -functional Materials for CO 2 Capture and Conversion  
In addition to efficient absorption of CO 2 from the atmosphere, usage of the absorbed CO 2 is a 
crucial feature i n combating global climate change caused by excessive emission of green gases. 
Several CO 2 conversion technologies, including electrochemical279-282 thermochemical283-286, as 
well as photochemical and photoelectrochemical287-289 methods, are in the process  of development 
shown in Figure 25.  
 
Figure 25. Three technologies of CO 2 conversion by using dual functional materials (DMF)  
By combining a CO 2 capture phase with a CO 2 conversion step using dual -functional materials 
(DFM), it is possible to deploy a re active carbon capture strategy. In this concept, once the CO 2 
capture materials bind to CO 2, they do not release CO 2 via an energy -intensive desorption process, 
but instead act as an electrolyte additive to transport the captured CO 2 molecules to the catal ytic 
34 
 sites for the subsequent thermochemical or electrochemical CO 2 reduction. The CO 2 capture 
materials are renewed for the subsequent CO 2 capture cycle following the conversion phase. Thus, 
the overall energy need for CO 2 capture and conversion might be drastically decreased. For 
example, A combination of CO 2 adsorbents (i.e. CaO) and common active metals for CO 2 
conversion (i.e. NiO and FeOX) may be used to create catalytic systems such as Ni/CaO and 
Fe2O3/CaO -Al2O3, whic h demonstrate high CO 2 adsorption capacity and product variety by 
creating CO, CH 4, and methanol290,291. These characteristics enable DFM to first absorb CO 2 from 
diluted flue gases and then sequentially complete the catalytic conversion process when the i nput 
gas changes from flue gas to reducing agent292. 
Modern DFM materials with dual roles for CO 2 adsorption and chemical conversion stages include 
metal -organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and 2D transition metal 
carbides and ni trides (MXene)293-296. The majority of these DFMs however still have issues with 
low CO 2 selectivity, poor electrical conductivity, poor chemical stability, harsh/complicated 
chemical production, high cost, etc. which severely limits the overall efficiency  of the 
process297,298. As a result, research is increasingly focusing on the development of innovative 
DFMs for increased CO 2 collection capacity and improved conversion properties (i.e., activity and 
stability).  
7.1 Electrochemical CO 2 reduction  
Electroc hemical CO 2 reduction is frequently one of the most effective ways to reduce the excessive 
CO 2 output because of the following advantages: The electrocatalytic process uses electrons rather 
than hydrogen to reduce; it takes place under mild circumstances; the products may be reformed 
utilizing a variety of electrolyte potentials, temperatures, and concentrations; and it can be 
controlled to minimize side products299. Numerous substances, such as liquid products like formic 
acid (HCOOH), methanol (CH 3OH), an d ethanol (C 2H5OH), as well as gases like carbon monoxide 
(CO), methane (CH 4), and ethylene (C 2H4), may be successfully separated from process 
byproducts using a condenser.  
To keep the electrodes adequately moist and prevent solvent loss, it is preferable for the 
electrolytes to have low volatility. Electrolytes with high salt concentrations, low volatility, and 
customizable physical characteristics include ionic liquids (ILs )300,301 and deep eutectic solvents 
(DESs)302-304. As a result, they are potential multifunctional electrolytes for processes that combine 35 
 capture and conversion. However, the high viscosities and poor conductivities that these 
electrolytes often exhibit r esult in transport rates that are substantially slower than ideal for 
practical applications. It could be interesting to construct these electrolytes using aqueous 
systems305. 
Novel materials, such as nanoparticle organic hybrid materials and ionic liquids , have been 
proposed as promising options for reactive carbon capture due to their high CO 2 capture 
capabilities and charged nature. They may be constructed by optimizing the CO 2 binding energy. 
Research has demonstrated that these innovative electrolyte m aterials can enhance CO 2 conversion 
rates and product distributions306. For instance, Park’s group demonstrated that the reactivity of 
nanoparticle organic hybrid materials attached to CO 2 differs from the reactivity of free CO 2, 
demonstrating the possible  co-catalytic function of nanoparticle organic hybrid materials during 
electrochemical CO 2 conversion307-312. The schematic of an electrochemical cell containing 
NOHM -based electrolytes has been shown in Figure 26.  
 
Figure 26. (A) Schematic of an electroc hemical cell with electrolytes based on NOHM. (B) The 
structure of the NOHM -I-HPE synthesized for this work. Illustrated are potential hydrogen 
bonding interactions with the secondary fluid (i.e., water).  
As of this writing, the solid oxide electrolysis ce ll (SOEC) is the special technology that brings 
CO 2 reduction to CO closer to commercialization313,314, shown in Figure 27. Because the ionic 
conductivity of electrolyte materials increases significantly with temperature, pure CO 2 or a mixed 
gas with high concentration of CO 2 must be added to SOECs. Normally, SOECs are configured to 
operate at a temperature of between 600 and 850 °C314. In order to attain zero emissions, low -
36 
 temperature electrolysis is better suited for removing CO 2 from the air and decreas ing it without 
having to deal with N 2, O2, and H 2O. 
 
Figure 27. At the electrodes of a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC), water or carbon dioxide are 
separated. SOEC stacks, which are composed of several cells, are then composed into SOEC 
plants. The m anufacturing of chemicals and transportation fuels may be separated from the usage 
of fossil fuels when renewable power is employed. Other electrolysis methods cannot match the 
electrolysis efficiency of SOECs, which run at high temperatures.  
7.2 Thermoche mical CO 2 reduction  
Recent investigations have revealed that dual function materials (DFM) containing noble metals 
such as Ni315-321 or Ru322-335 supported by r -Al2O3 integrate adsorption and conversion to methane 
and other light alkanes336-342. equations (1) - (5) and Figure 28 depict the topography inside the 
Ru-based DFM. CO 2 was collected at the interface between Na 2O and oxygen to create carbonated 
species, whereas Ru was oxidized to generate RuO 2 or RuO x. RuO x would be reduced to Ru after 
the introduction of hydrogen, allowing CO 2 molecules to transfer from Na 2O sites to Ru sites for 
the methanation process.

The results of 10 cycles of adsorption, desorption and CH 4 production in dry air condition are 
shown in Figure 29a and 5 cycles in 2 % wet air condition shown in Figure 29b. The average 
adsorption under humid condition is about 1.3 mmol CO2/gDFM, which is 2.36 -fold increasing 
compared to dry condition. It is extra ordinarily desired to convert CO 2 directly into methane to 
decrease environmental CO 2 emissions and store renewable energy343. In addition, the effect of Rh 
particle size on the activity and reaction process of CO 2 methanation over Rh/TiO 2 catalysts at low  
temperatures (85 - 165 °C) and atmospheric pressure344 was examined.

condition. (b) 5 cycles in 2 % wet air condition.  
DFMs were also investigated to convert CO 2 to syngas by utilizing abundant base metals292. 
Researchers used a sequentially impregnated FeCrCu -K catalyst supported on hydrotalcite. The 
hydrotalcite support was first calcined at 600 °C to produce homogenous mixed oxides of MgO 
and Al 2O3, and then the metals (Fe, Cr, and Cu) were deposited using the incipient wetness 
technique using nitrate precursors. A K 2CO 3 solution was impregnated over the sample after it had 
been dried and calcined at 500 °C, and the samp le was then dried and calcined once more at the 
same temperature. The CO 2 was captured using 5.8% CO 2/N2 and hydrogenated using pure H 2 at 
a temperature between 450 and 550 °C. Figure 30 displays the CO 2 and CO concentration patterns 
through the stages of capture and reduction. As can be observed, CO 2 is successfully adsorbed 
onto the alkali metal (K), where it forms surface carbonates. Once the reaction is switched to H 2, 
the majority of the captured CO 2 combines with H 2 over the catalytic sites (Fe, Cr, a nd Cu), 
releasing CO and some unconverted CO 2.

concentration profiles of syngas.  
To comprehend the basic chemical processes and active sites involved in these, Hy akutake et al.  
345 investigated the impact of boosting a Cu/Al 2O3 catalyst with K and Ba for application in CO 2 
collection and conversion. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE), which uses CO 2 
as a mild oxidant, Al -Mamoori et al.346 studied the use of potassium - and sodium -based calcium 
oxide double salts (K -Ca and Na -Ca) adsorbents physically combined with an H -ZSM -5-supported 
Cr catalyst. Since ethylene is one of the most essential building components in the chemical 
industry, this  reaction is extremely alluring347. 
7.3 Photochemical and Photoelectrochemical CO 2 reduction  
Due to the abundant and free availability of sunshine, photoreduction of CO 2—which mimics the 
natural process of photosynthesis —is one of the most enticing process es for CO 2 conversion. The 
fundamental mechanism leading to primary production in the biosphere is photosynthesis, which 
annually eliminates more than 100 billion tons of CO 2 from the atmosphere. There are around 
7,000 billion tons of CO 2 in the atmosphere348. However, a truly biomimetic photosynthetic 
system, like the ones inspired by Rubisco that have been proposed for directly absorbing CO 2 from 
the air, is still a long way off from being realized349-352. 
40 
 Lewis and Nocera353 have suggested using the phot osynthetic process to transform solar energy 
into molecules (H 2, methanol, and hydrocarbons) and store them to fulfill the world's energy needs. 
A typical photoreduction electrode consists of a semiconducting material and photocatalysts, the 
majority of wh ich are complexes of transition metals. Semiconductors absorb photons to cause 
excited electrons to shift from a valence band to a conducting band. These excited electrons are 
subsequently transported to a photocatalyst complex, which converts CO 2 to CO an d other 
valuable organic molecules.  
According to Kumar et al .354, the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 to CO on Re(bipy -
But)(CO)3Cl(bipy -But = 4,4' -di-tert-butyl -2,2-bipyridine)/p -type silicon achieved a faradic 
efficiency of 97±3%, and a short -circuit quan tum efficiency of 61% for conversion. According to 
calculations based on density functional theory (DFT), the nature of the binding of CO 2 to the 
anion results in the formation of a Re(bipy -tBu)(CO) 3(CO 2)K complex355, shown in Figure 31.  
 
Figure 31.  Schematic of a device for photoelectrochemically reducing CO 2 using a p -Si/ Re(bipy -
tBu)(CO) 3Cl semiconductor/molecular catalyst junction.  
By using a hybrid semiconductor nanowire -bacteria system, Yang’s group356-360 have developed 
an artificia l photosynthesis that can turn CO 2 into goods like fuels, polymers, and drug precursors. 
High -surface -area silicon nanowire arrays absorb solar energy to provide reducing equivalents to 
the anaerobic bacterium sporomusa ovata with low overpotential (200 mV ), high Faradic 
efficiency (up to 90%), and long -term stability (up to 200 h) for the photoelectrochemical 
41 
 production of acetic acid under ambient conditions (21% O 2)356. A biohybrid coculture was created 
by researchers from the same group for tandem and c ontrollable CO 2 and N 2 fixation to value -
added products360.

nodules of legumes, where the legume supplies them with organics (such as malate). The legume 
utilis es the nitrogenous chemicals that the rhizobia fix N 2 to for growth. In the concept, the legume 
is replaced with a SiNW/S. ovata ensemble that produces acetate from CO 2. R. palustris utilizes 
the acetate as a feedstock to change N 2 into NH 3, much like rhiz obia. The biohybrid platform's 
solar energy is represented as a ray of light, with the letter v particularly denoting the light energy. 
(Inset) Vigna unguiculata root nodules are shown in the image.  
According to Schmid et al.361, Figure 33 depicts a photos ynthetic system with a solar -powered 
electrolyzer (e). They employed a commercially available silver -based gas diffusion cathode to 
solve the insufficient current densities and significantly increase the stability of the electrolyzer. 
With a current densit y of 300 mA•cm-2, it may run continuously for more than 1200 hours. In the 
fermentation module attached to the CO 2 electrolyzer, the outgoing syngas was converted with 
high carbon selectivity to butanol and hexanol, and this process achieved about 100% of the 
Faradaic efficiency. Compared to early expectations, the provided adaptive hybrid system puts 
artificial photosynthesis closer to industrial scale production of valuable and useful chemicals.

8. Summary and Outlook:  
 
Concerns about climate change may soon force significant reductions in CO 2 emissions. To 
address this issue, it might be required to reduce the environmental impact of fossil fuels by 
capturing and sequestering CO 2 until more affordable, eco -friendly, and abundant technologies are 
available. Even though there have been considera ble advances in CO 2 capture and sequestration 
from the air, there are still numerous problems must be solved in the near future.  
Solid sorbents are essential for removing CO 2 from the air. Direct Air Capture is a relatively new 
technology and faces numerou s obstacles. A potential sorbent needs to be extremely CO 2 selective 
and easily uptake CO 2 from the air. It has high capacity and fast kinetics. It is essential that the 
procedure for releasing CO 2 from the sorbent is efficient and easy. The sorbent needs to endure 
thousands of sorbent cycles. The price must also be reasonable.  
Electrified process heat is carbon -free if it is driven by zero -carbon energy generated on -site. 
Compared to other low -carbon process heating methods, electrification comprises a vas t array of 
technologies that can accommodate the different uses and temperature requirements unique to the 
manufacturing industry. To become technically and economically practical, electrifying industrial 
heating processes will require overcoming a number of technological obstacles. For instance, 
design the procedure for electric heating to more efficiently heat the target. The optimal technology 
option for CO 2 sorbent regeneration may vary based on the operation scales and composition of 
the material.  
43 
 Although solid amines have been extensively acknowledged as promising DAC sorbents with high 
CO 2 collection capacity and selectivity, their CO 2 adsorption mechanisms are still unknown. 
Complex computer modeling and prediction of amine reaction processes, chemi cal and physical 
characteristics, and structure -activity connections, over a spectrum of amine chemotypes, can play 
a significant role in complementing or enhancing limited experimental data. A synergistic 
combination of experimental and computational meth odologies expedites the identification of an 
amine capture agent's ideal qualities compared to the use of experiments alone. Such an approach 
will expedite the development of the next generation of CO 2 capture materials based on amines. 
Computational appro aches will become an increasingly valuable and complementary adjunct to 
experiments for the purpose of comprehending the processes of amine -CO 2 reactions and 
designing carbon capture agents with acceptable costs and toxicity.  
Dual -functional materials for CO 2 capture and utilization are promising future prospects with the 
potential to create alternate routes in the sustainable chemical manufacturing and renewable energy 
storage industries. In addition, dual -functional materials provide additional options an d the 
flexibility to target more valuable items that cannot be manufactured in a single step. With the 
exception of solid oxide electrolysis, however, the current readiness level of the electrochemical 
components is relatively low. Consequently, a substant ial amount of effort is required to overcome 
crucial difficulties such as long -term stability, product selectivity, and cost -competitiveness 
relative to conventional industrial methods. As the development of DFMs is still in its infancy, the 
majority of pu blications have focused on the incorporation of sorbents and catalytic species via 
impregnation techniques; the future of the field lies in the design of well -controlled 
nanoarchitectures with catalytic and sorbent components in close proximity for enhance d synergy. 
In the field of DFMs, the generation of higher energy density products, such as alcohols and higher 
hydrocarbons, is a nearly unexplored route.   
Overall, sorbents are essential to the success of DAC, and there is still considerable space for the ir 
enhancement. The pace of development must quicken because global warming cannot wait. Future 
research should assess every aspect of sorbents for DAC, including their stability, sorption 
kinetics, sorption capacity, selectivity, regeneration energy penal ty, and cost. To alleviate the 
problem of global climate change, energy -efficient and low -cost CO 2 sorbents must be used.  44
