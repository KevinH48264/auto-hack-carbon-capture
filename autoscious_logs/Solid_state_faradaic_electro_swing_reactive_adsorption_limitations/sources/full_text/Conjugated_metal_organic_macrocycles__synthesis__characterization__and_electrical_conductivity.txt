Here, we report the synthesis of CuTOTP-OR (TOTPn– = 2,3,6,7-tetraoxidotriphenylene), a family of copper-based macrocycles that resemble truncated fragments of the conductive two-dimensional (2D) metal–organic framework Cu3(HHTP)2 (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene). The planar metal–organic macrocycles self-assemble into ordered nanotubes with internal diameters of ∼2 nm and short interlayer distances of ∼3.20 Å. Strong π–π stacking interactions between macrocycles facilitate out-of-plane charge transport, and pressed pellet conductivities as high as 2(1) × 10–3 S cm–1 are observed. Peripheral alkyl functionalization enhances solution processability and enables the fabrication of thin-film field-effect transistor devices. Ambipolar charge transport is observed, suggesting that similar behavior may be operative in Cu3(HHTP)2. By coupling the attractive features of metal–organic frameworks with greater processability, these macrocycles enable facile device integration and a more nuanced understanding of out-of-plane charge transport in 2D conductive metal–organic frameworks.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.1c12596.Additional experimental details, synthetic procedures, and characterization data (PXRD, XAS, XPS, EPR, UV–Vis, and NMR) (PDF)ja1c12596_si_001.pdf (7.22 MB)
