Abstract  
The need for cost -effective carbon  dioxide  capture technology is rapidly increasing. To limit 
the global temperature increase to 1.5 °C within the next century, the level of CO 2 mitigation 
needs to increase drastically. Current  capture  technology , i.e., amine scrubbing, provides 
several challenges  that limit widespread deployment: high regeneration energy, high 
operational costs and degradation issues . An emerging energy -efficient technology that can 
address some of the limitations of amines  is electrochemically driven carbon dioxide capture . 
For e xample , redox -active  quinone  molecules are capable of captur ing carbon dioxide 
following electrochemical reduction, and can then be regenerated upon electrochemical 
oxidation. Despite great advances in the chemistry of quinones for electrochemical CO 2 
capture, however, the integration of quinones in carbon capture devices remains an ongoing 
challenge. Here we present a new class of quinone -functionalized electrodes for 
electrochemical CO 2 capture, using the diazonium radical reaction to graft quinone molecules 
to a porous  carbon surface. By grafting redox -active molecules to this conductive surface,  not 
only is carbon dioxide capture significantly enhanced when the bound quinone species a re 
electrochemically reduced, but the functionalization process also improves  the energy storage 
of the  carbon  material. Through constant current experiments in the presence of CO 2, 
reversible carbon capture was observed with initial  uptake capacities at 0.4 mmol g–1 which 
stabilizes to 0.2 mmol g–1 over 100 cycles  with an energy consumption of 254 kJ mol–1 per 
cycle . Our facile low -cost synthesis of quinone -functionalised carbons is highly tunable since 
both the carbon and redox -active molecule can be modified, and our work therefore paves the 
way for the design and discovery of improved electrode  materials for electroche mical CO 2 
capture.  
  Introduction  
Due to the rapid increase in anthropogenic CO 2 emissions over the past century, a number of 
technologies have been developed to reduce CO 2 emissions from point  sources.1–3 The most 
mature  technology is amine scrubbing, which employs amine molecules to capture CO 2 at a 
high concentration.4 Limitations of this technology include lo w CO 2 capacities , parasitic side -
reactions and large  regeneration  energies .5,6 Amine scrubbing utilizes a temperature -swing 
process and requires high temperatures to release CO 2 and regenerate the amines . 
Electrochemically driven  carbon dioxide capture is emerging as an energy -efficient alternative 
to thermally driven processes .7 Electrochemical systems can be operated under isothermal 
conditions, limiting energy loss via heat.  A range of electrochemical carbon dioxide capture 
systems have been reported, including those based on electrochemically driven pH swings,8 
capacitive systems,9,10 and systems that employ redox -active molecules such as quinones , 
both in protic and aprotic electrolytes .11–15 Using redox -active quinone molecules is one of the 
largest areas of research for new technologies due to their  highly reversible redox -activity and 
stoichiometric capture of CO 2 upon reduction.  
Electrochemically  driven carboxylation of reduced quinones ha s been well docum ented .16,17 
While neutral anthraquinone does not show carbon dioxide binding, electrochemical reduction 
to form  a radical anion (1 electron reduction) or dianion (2 electron reduction) activates this 
molecule to bind  CO 2 in either an EEC C or ECEC (E = electron transfer, C = chemical reaction) 
mechanism  (Scheme 1 ).18 While most early studies used analytical electrochemistry 
techniques to study the  carbon dioxide capture of quinones and other redox -active 
molecules,19,20 more recent work has begun to develop practical devices that can capture 
carbon dioxide in an electrochemically driven process.21  
 
One approach  for making devices  is to use quinones  dissolved in solution  in a flow  battery -
like system ,22,23 though these systems suffer from low quinone solubility as well as the  
crossover of redox -active molecules through the separator membrane , causing capac ity fade . 
An alternative  approach  that can address these issues  is to immobilize quinones in a solid -
state  electrode in a battery -like architecture. Initial approaches in this direction used solid -state Scheme 1. Anthraquinone redox activity in the presence of CO 2. This scheme shows an EEC C mechanism , though an 
ECEC mechanism is also thought to operate . 
quinone electrodes  to electrochemically capture carbon dioxide , yet they  suffered from  
significant  instability due to quinone dissolution into the organic electrolyte s used,24,25  leading  
to a cap acity loss when cycling. Research by Voskian et al.26 address ed this challenge by 
developing electrodes comprised of poly(anthraquinone) and carbon nanotubes  and 
demonstrated electrochemical CO 2 capture  at a variety of CO 2 concentrations. Notably, the  
poly(anthraquinone) electrodes could be stacked, allowing higher CO 2 adsorption capacities 
to be achieved. However , a limitation  of this approach is the complex synthesis of the polymer 
electrode, which requires expensive coupling agents . This motivates  the need for the 
development of new classes of inexpensive , easily synthesized  quinone -functionalized  
electrodes that are  broadly tunable for electrochemical CO 2 capture . 
In the search for new quinone -based electro des for electrochemical carbon dioxide capture, 
we were inspired by previous work on the covalent functionalisation of carbon electrodes for 
energy storage applications.27 Quinone functionalisation provides additional energy storage 
capacity through Faradaic processes, adding to the initial capacity of the carbon from non-
Faradaic electrochemical double -layer capacitance.28 The use of a covalent attachment 
between quinon e molecules and the carbon backbone prevents the dissolution of the redox -
active molecule into the electrolyte, increasing the cycle  life of the electrode.  Furthermore, this 
attachment ensures facile electron transfer to and from grafted molecules. A popul ar approach 
for covalently attaching  quinones to activated carbon is to use the spontaneous diazonium 
radical reaction.29,30 This well -understood reaction allows a range of materials to be 
investigated, as the reaction s are tolerant to a diverse set of  quinones and conductive carbon 
materials ,31,32 and only  require an inexpensive radical initiator to be stirred with the activated 
carbon material and quinone molecule present in solution.  Quinone -functionalised activated 
carbon s have previously been reported as improved energy storage material s, however , they  
have not yet been implemented in carbon capture technology. 33  
In this work we develop quinone -functionalised porous carbon materials for electrochemically 
driven carbon d ioxide capture. We demonstrate that the incorporation of quinones increases 
the energy storage capacity of the carbon electrodes, while at the same time introducing 
electrochemically mediated carbon dioxide capture. Our work paves the way for the 
developme nt of new materials that can help mitigate climate change.

Synthesis of functionalized CMK -3 (f-CMK -3). 
Pognon et al. have previously shown that anthraquinone -grafted carbons can be synthesized  
by adding a diazonium radical  initiator  and 2-aminoanthraquinone ( 2-AAQ ) to a porous carbon 
material.29 This study found that  the anthraquinone loading on the surface could be changed 
using a variety of concentrations and mixing times . Our synthesis adapted  the conditions  that 
showed the highest anthraquinone loading  from the literature protocol by mixing 2 -AAQ and 
CMK -3 together for 24 hours prior to the addition of a radical initiator , allow ing time for the 2 -
AAQ to diffuse into the inner pores in the carbon network, promoting an even distribution and 
reducing side reactions such as polymerization.35–38 For a microporous carbon, the diffusion 
of anthraquinone into the carbon network can block some  pores, leading to a loss of surface 
area and a lower  quinone loading .39 Pore blockages also affect the electrochemical behaviour, 
as it limits ionic transport of the electrolyte to the charged surface, thus leading to a loss in 
electrochemical capacity.40 This can be overcome by using mesoporous carbons with pore 
sizes between 2 and 10 nm to facilitate electrolyte accessibility . As such, CMK -3, a 
mesoporous carbon with a pore diameter > 4 nm, was  ultimately  chosen for electrochemical 
quinone grafting.  Mesopor ous CMK -3 (50 mg, 1 equiv.) and 2 -AAQ (0.28 g, 3 equiv.) were stirred in degassed 
acetonitrile for 16 hours  under N 2. Tert-butyl nitrite ( 0.13 g, 1 equiv. compared to 2 - AAQ) was 
added and the mixture was stirred for 30 min , and then  another 1 equiv. of tert-butyl nitrite 
was added to the organic suspension. This process was repeated until a total of 3 equiv. of 
tert-butyl nitrite w ere added. The s uspension was kept at ambient temperature while stirring 
under N 2. After 4 h, the reaction mixture was vacuum  filtered on a nylon filtration membrane 
and the f-CMK -3 powder was washed with successive aliquots of acetonitrile  (500 mL) , DMF  
(500 mL) , acetone (100 mL) and methanol (100 mL) and dried in a vacuum oven at 100  °C for 
12 h.  The final weight percentage increase after functionalisation was 2 2 ± 7 wt. %.  
For a control experiment, the procedure was repeated without including the tert -butyl nitrite 
reagent (which is required to form the diazonium species, and for covalent functionalisation to 
take place).  
Gas sorption. Low-pressure  N2 isotherms (adsorption and desorption) were collected using 
an Anton Parr Autosorb iQ -XR at 77 K. An oven -dried sample cell (Type A long cell, 9 mm 
outer diameter, LG bulb) was tared before being loaded with a sample. Ex-situ degassing 
(110 °C, dynamic vacuum, 16 h) was performed before the evacuated tube was weighed again 
to determine the sample mass. Isotherms were collected over 24 – 30 h, and the samples 
were reweighed following analysis to ensure accurate mass readings. Sorption isotherms 
were evacuated in As iQwin version 5.21 software. Brunauer –Emmett –Teller (BET)  surface 
areas were calculated from isotherms using the BET equation and Rouquerol’s consistency 
criteria implemented in AsiQwin.41,42  
Fourier -transform infrared spectroscopy (FT -IR). Spectra were  recorded on  PerkinElmer 
FT-IR Spectrometer in the region of 600 – 3600 cm-1.  
Elemental Analysis.  C, H and N concentrations were determined via CHN combustion 
analysis using an Exeter Analytical CE -440, with combustion at 975  °C. 
Thermogravim etric Analysis (TGA).  Spectra were recorded on T GA/DSC 2  from Mettler 
Toledo . Samples of typically 20 mg were placed in CC21 Cylindrical Alumina C rucible and 
heated from 25 to 900 °C at 5 °C /min, under flowing N 2 atmosphere.  
Scanning Electron  Microscopy – Energy Dispersive X -ray (SEM -EDX) . SEM images and 
chemical composition were acquired using a TESCAN MIRA3 FEG -SEM equipped with an 
Oxford Instruments X -maxN 80 EDX detector. SEM images were acquired at 5kV and EDX 
spectra at 10kV  
Solid State NMR. Experiments were performed using a Bruker Avance I spectrometer 
equipped with a 9.4 T wide -bore magnet, corresponding to a 1H Larmor frequency ( 0) of 400 MHz, using a Bruker 3.2 mm HXY triple resonance probe at an MAS frequency ( R) of 20 kHz. 
13C MAS NMR experiments were acquired using a radiofrequency field strength ( 1) of 62.5 
kHz. Recycle delays were experimentally optimised to 10 s for f -CMK3/Cr(acac) 3 and 0.5 s for 
u-CMK3/Cr(acac) 3. Number of transients acquired were 2048 and 6144, respectively. Sample 
prepara tion: 50 mg of CMK -3 was mixed with 1 ml 0.5 wt/vl% Cr(acac) 3 in EtOH to create a 
slurry. The solvent was allowed to evaporate overnight, affording a solid.  
Electrode preparation.  
Freestanding composite electrode films were prepared by adapting an existing literature 
method.43 f-CMK -3 powder (50 mg) was mixed with ethanol ( ca. 1.5 mL) to produce a loose 
slurry. This was sonicated for 15 min before being added to a PTFE dispersion in a few drops 
of ethanol in a watch glass. The slurry was stirred by hand in the watch glass for 30 min under 
ambient conditio ns. The film was gradually formed upon ffdrying of the slurry before being 
transferred to a glass surface, where it was kneaded with a spatula  for 10 mins to ensure 
homogenous incorporation of the activated  material and PTFE and then rolled into a 
freestanding film using a homemade aluminium  rolling pin. The film was dried in vacuo  at 
100  °C for at least 24 h to remove any excess ethanol. The masses of components were 
calculated so that the final film had a composition of 95 wt% f -CMK -3 and 5 wt% PTFE.  
The same procedure was used for all freestanding composite films and all films had a 
thickness of ca. 250 𝜇m. A similar procedure  was used to make YP -80F films, except the 
carbon material used was  as-purchased  microporous YP -80F. 
For a control experiment,  CMK -3 (50 mg)  was prepared in the presence of  dissolved  
anthraquinon e (5 mg, 10 wt. %) in ethanol (5 mL). The suspension was stirred for 2 hours then 
kneaded to create an electrode film. Similarly, another control experiment followed the 
diazonium radical reaction without the addition of the radical initiator . CMK -3 (50 mg , 1 equiv. ) 
and 2 -AAQ (0.28 g, 0.3 equiv.)   were stirred in degassed acetonitrile for 16 hours  under N 2 
and then washed following the synthetic procedure explained above.  
Two-electrode c ells for electrochemical analysis were prepared as coin cells in Cambr idge 
Energy Solutions CR2032 SS316 coin cell cases. Film electrodes were cut from freestanding 
composite f -CMK -3 and YP -80F films with areal mass loadings of f -CMK -3 ranging between 
5 − 11 mg cm-2. The m inimum weight ratio between the negative (f-CMK -3) and positive 
(YP80F) electrode was 1: >2.5 , respectively . This ensured excess charging capacity  on the 
YP-80F electrode  (relative to the f -CMK -3 electrode) . Therefore,  the potential on the working 
f-CMK -3 electrode is expected to limit the stable working voltage range for the cel l. Whatman 
glass microfiber filter (GF/A) was used as a separator  and dried in vacuo at 100 °C for 24 h 
prior to use. 1 -Butyl -3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl)imide  ionic liquid  (200 𝜇m) was used as an electrolyte in all experiments. All electrochemical cells were assembled 
inside a glovebox under an inert nitrogen (N 2) atmosphere. Each coin cell contained two 
SS316 spacer  disks and one SS316 spring to ensure sufficient and consistent pressure in the 
cells. The coin cells were sealed in the glovebox using a Compact Hydraulic Coin Cell Crimper 
(Cambridge Energy Solutions) before being removed for testing.  
Electrochemical Cel l Characterisation.  
Cyclic voltammetry (CV)  and constant current  experiments were performed on Biologic 
potentiostats (VSP -3e and VMP -3e) and the electrochemical set -up was controlled with 
Biologic EC -Lab V11.43 software. The CV scans were performed at a scan rate of 5 mV s-1 
for all cells unless otherwise stated.  
Electrochemical gas cell  experiments.  
Electrochemical gas adsorption experiments were carried out with a custom -made device  
reported previo usly (Figure S1.1 ).44 Electrochemical cells for gas measurements were 
assembled in meshed coin cells from MTI Corporation  (CR2032 -CASE -MESH, 1  mm holes ) 
and placed in gas manifold devices with f-CMK3 -K electrodes  exposed to the gas reservoir. 
Devices were then evacuated for 10 mins and filled with pure CO 2 gas (> 1.01 bar) . This was 
repeated three times  to fully exchange the N 2 gas (from the glovebox environment in which 
the cells were prepared) with CO 2. The electrochemical cells were placed in an incubator oven 
(SciQuip Incu -80S) at 35  °C. This temperature was consistent with similar literature systems, 
enabling accurate comparison.26 The constant  current was applied across the cell and the 
increase and  decrease in pressure in the device, upon release and capture, respectively, was 
monitored using a pressure transducer (Omega, PX309 -030A5V)  which was connected to the 
potentiostat as an external device, enabling simultaneous electrochemistry and cell gas 
pressure measurements.  
Constant -current experiments with constant voltage holding steps were carried out while 
simultaneously monitoring how the CO 2 pressure in the system varied. A decrease in pressure 
is then characteristic of CO 2 capture by the functionalized electrode an d an increase in 
pressure is CO 2 release . The pressure difference between  capture and release was then used 
to calculate the numb er of CO 2 molecules captured using the ideal gas law.  
  Results and Discussion  
Electrode fabrication and c haracter ization  
 
Targeting a quinone -functionalised carbon material for electrochemical CO 2 capture, we 
adapted a previously developed synthetic route that employs a diazonium radical reaction 
(Scheme 2 ). We selected CMK -3 mesoporous carbon and 2 -aminoanthraquinone  to yield the 
anthraquinone functionalised carbon, f -CMK -3. We hypothesized that t he use of a 
mesoporous carbon for the functionalisation reaction would  avoid pore blockage,  leaving 
sufficient porosity following functionalization for electrolyte and CO 2 access during 
electrochemical CO 2 capture.45  
N2 gas sorption  isotherms at 77  K showed  typical  Type IV adsorption -desorption hysteresis  
loops for u-CMK -3 and f -CMK -3, consistent with the presence  of mesopores,46 as well as a 
steep uptake a t low relative pressures (0.0 to 0.1 P/P 0), consistent with the presence of 
micropores  (Figure 1A  & Section S2). Upon quinone grafting, f -CMK -3 show s a decrease in  
adsorbed  volume at relative pressures  greater  than 0.5 P/P 0, suggesting that anthraquinone 
molecules have been grafted in the carbon mesopores, rather than in the micropores . Our 
findings are consistent with previous studies, that also attributed a decrease in surface area  
after quinone  grafting to the presence of quinone s on the carbon structure.32 However, gas 
sorption  alone  cannot be used to infer whether chemical grafting of anthraquinone has taken

place , as a similar sorption profile  may be seen regardless of whether anthraquinone was 
physisorbed or chemisorbed to the carbon surface . Furthermore, as molecular nitrogen has a 
significantly smaller radius than ions used in the ionic liquid electrolyte,  1-butyl -3-
methylimidazolium bis( trifluoromethyl sulfonyl )imide  ([bmim][T FSI]), gas sorption cannot 
provide information about the electrochemical accessibility of pores.47 In summary, the gas 
sorption measurements support the presence of  anthraquinones  within the mesoporous 
carbon  and show that significant porosity is retained, which should enable CO 2 species to 
enter the pores in electrochemical carbon capture measurements.  
To ascertain whether anthraquinone was covalently attached to  the CMK -3 support , FT-IR 
was used to monitor the loss of amine group s from 2-AAQ following  functionalization  (Figure 
1B & Figure S 3.1) as well as the presence of the quinone carbonyls . 48 Activated c arbon is

 highly absorbing of IR light,  resulting in low signal intensity  for both CMK -3 samples . However,  
weak anthraquinone peaks can still be identified in f -CMK -3. The peaks for N –H and C –N 
bonds, shown at 3500  (Figure S 3.2), 1650 – 1580 (blue shaded) and 1342 – 1266 cm-1, 
respectively , 49 were observed in the 2-AAQ spectrum but w ere absent in  u-CMK -3 and  f-CMK -
3. Though the signal intensities are weak for these samples , C–N modes are predicted to have 
strong transmittance due to aryl resonance and  their absence , as well as the lack of N –H 
peaks in the f -CMK -3 spectrum , support  the lo ss of amine groups  during anthraquinone 
grafting . This was also supported by energy -dispersive X -ray spectroscopy ( EDX) 
measurements where nitrogen was absent in the chemical composition of f -CMK -3 (Figure  
S4.1 and Figure S4.2 ). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) did show a trace amount of 
nitrogen however, the origin was unknown ( Figure S 5.1). Meanwhile,  the stretch of the 
carbonyl group at 1650  cm-1 (red shaded) was seen in both the 2 -AAQ and f -CMK -3 spectra  
but not the u -CMK -3 spectrum, confirming the presence of quinone in the functionalised 
carbon . Peaks seen in f -CMK -3 at 1290  cm-1 are also present in anthraquinone and therefore 
are not assigned to C –N bond in 2 -AAQ. The absence of N–H peaks in the f-CMK -3 spectrum 
supports the loss of the amine group during the radical synthesis, resulting in anthraquinone 
being covalently grafted to the CMK -3 structure. Solid state 13C NMR was used to further 
confirm the presence of anthraquinone in the f -CMK -3 structure ( Figure 1C ). An intense  broad 
peak  was observed at approximately 120 ppm for both samples, and was assigned to 
graphitic -like sp2-hybridised carbon. The highlighted  peak at 180 ppm for f-CMK -3 structure 
supports the  additional presence of carbonyl bonds  in anthra quinone units after 
functionalisation. Consis tent with this, X -ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed an 
increase in the carbonyl  signal following functionalisation ( Figure S 5.1). 
Electrochemical measure ments  further support the success of the functionalisation reaction 
and allow the amount of electrochemically accessible anthraquinone to be quantified. Cyclic 
voltammetry (CV) curves  on two -electrode cells  show clear differences  in the charge storage  
behavio urs of f-CMK -3 and u -CMK -3 (Figure 1D). In these measurements , a microporous 
carbon, YP80F, with excess  charge  storage capacity was used as the positively charged 
electrode . The CV curve of  the u-CMK -3 cell (black line) displays  typical electrochemical  
double -layer capacitive beha viour, identified by  a square -like CV with the absence of obvious 
redox peaks . This so-called “double -layer capacity ” seen in activated carbon materials arises 
from capacitor -like energy storage at the in terface  between the electronically charge d carbon 
surface and oppositely charged  ions in the electrolyte.  In contrast , the CV curve of  f-CMK -3 
exhibits two charge storage mechanisms : (a) double -layer capacitance , evidenced by a 
rectangular contribution, and (b) Faradaic charge storage, evidenced by  two redox  couples 
centered  at cell voltages of  –1.5 V and –2.2 V which correspond  to the two 1 e– reduction/oxidation  processes  of anthra quinone.50 A slight loss of double -layer capacity was 
seen at  low cell voltages (e.g. , –0.5 V ) upon functionalization , likely  owing to the reduction in 
surface area and pore blockage after anthraquinone  functionalization  on CMK -3, as seen by 
gas sorption . However, the overall charge -storage capacity increased by 25% from 39 to 52 
mA h g–1 owing to the addition of the Faradaic contributions . 
Assuming  any difference in charge  storage  for the two carbons could be attributed to 
anthraquinone, the estimated quin one loading was calculated to be 9 ± 1 wt.% (Section S6), 
which was within  the range of what is expected from the literature synthesis.29 In this case, 
the small  loss of double -layer capacity upon functionalization was ignored for simplification.  
The cell voltage window was limited by the stability of the electrolyte therefore two full 
reduction peaks could not be obtained . This suggests the quinone loading  report ed above  is 
an underestimation of the amount of AQ present.  Indeed, a simple estimation of the 
anthraquinone loading based on the sample mass increase following function alisation gave a 
higher value of 22 ± 7 wt. % (see experimental). This means that we ca nnot rule out the 
presence of some electro chemically inactive anthraquinone in f -CMK -3. We also explored 
further techniques to explore the incorporation of anthraquinones in f -CMK -3, including EDX 
(Table S 4.1), XPS ( Table S 5.2) and TGA , (Figure S7.1)). However, accurate quantification 
of anthraquinone loading from these techniques was not p ossible. Ultimately, we believe the 
electrochemical techniques are the best method to determine quinone  loading as they indicate  
the quantity of quinone that is electrochemically accessible and therefore would partake in an 
electrochemical carbon capture process.  
To further confirm anthraquinone was chemisorbed to CMK -3, control experiments were 
carried out . When the reaction  was carri ed out without the addition of the TBN radical initiator, 
the resulting electrode  material showed a cyclic voltammogram very similar to u -CMK -3, with 
no obvious Faradaic contributions from anthraquinone observed , suggesting that physisorbed 
anthraquinone and 2 -AAQ is removed during the washing steps of the synthesis  (Figure 
S8.1). Similarly, when u-CMK -3 was mixed with dissolved anthraquinone during the electrode 
film-making  process,  clear redox peaks were again not observed  (Figure S 8.1). In summary, 
the grafting of anthraquinone onto the carbon surface was confirmed using a range of 
characterization techniques  and control experiments , with the amount of electrochemically 
accessible anthraquinone on the surface estimated with a lower limit of 9 wt.%.29  
Electrochemical c arbon  dioxide  capture measurements  
Having successfully prepared anthraquinone -functionalised CMK -3, i.e., f-CMK -3, 
electrochemistry measurements were carried out in the presence of CO 2 to access whether 
this material could capture CO 2 in an electrochemically driven process. Preliminary evidence for electrochemical CO 2 capture was obtained from CV experiments , where differences in the 
two-electrode CV profiles were observed under N 2 and CO 2 (Figure 2A). Under N 2, the CV 
curve of the cell  show s two redox events , while  under CO 2, the redox peaks are shifted , 
coalescing into a single broad  peak at –1.9 V. A smaller peak at –0.75 V is also observed  and 
has been previously linked to  a stabilized quinone intermediate .13 Peak shifts have  previously 
been reported in other quinone -based systems under the presen ce of CO 2,11,52 with the second 
reduction peak generally reported to shift  to more positive potentials  while the potential of the 
first reduction peak remains largely unchanged.  A shift in the second reduction peak to more 
positive potentials is caused by the reaction of the reduced quinone species with carbon 
dioxide. This is thought to make the second reduction more thermodynamically favorable 
through the stabilization of the pr oducts, leading to a shift of the second reduction peak to 
more positive potentials . The movement of both redox peaks that we observe for f-CMK -3 has 
not been previously reported in quinone -based CO 2 capture  chemistry . The  cause for the  
coalescence  of the two redox events  is currently unknown , however , a shifting of peaks in the 
CV curves gave preliminary evidence for carbon dioxide capture by f -CMK -3. More conclusive evidence for electrochemically driven CO 2 capture was provided by charging 
experiments during which the CO 2 pressure  was mo nitored  in a custom electrochemical cell . 
To isolate the Faradaic and double -layer capacity  contributions to CO 2 capture , three different  
voltage  windows were explored . A voltage  window of 0 to –1 V was  first used to avoid 
anthraquinone redox -activity on f -CMK -3, which  meant any pressure variation seen would not 
be due to anthraquinone redox ( Figure 2B). The measurements in this voltage range  show 
negligible pressure variation s, similar to what is seen for u -CMK -3 in the sam e voltage range 
(Figure  S9.2). Experiments under  an N2 environment  also showed minimal pressure variation  
(Figure S 10.2 & S11.2). 
A voltage range of –1 to –2 V was then used to isolate anthraquinone redox activity and 
monitor electrochemically driven adsorption ( Figure 2C). When  the f-CMK -3 cell was charged 
to –2 V, a decrease in pressure ( red line) is observed, indicating the capture of CO 2. When  
the f-CMK -3 electrode is  then discharged to 0 V , the pressure in the system increases owing 
to the release of CO 2. The pressure oscillations are synchronous with the electrochemical 
charging and discharging , demonstrating  that the reduction and oxidation of anthraquinone 
drive  the capture and release of carbon dioxide.  This cell voltage range shows that targeting

Experiments ran was a constant current at 0.1 A g–1 then voltage was held for 10 mins. B) 0 to -1 V, pressure – green line.

the redox activity of anthraquinone leads to carbon capture.  Finally, experiments where the 
voltage was cycled between 0 and –2.5 V again revealed reversible capture and release of 
carbon dioxide, and showed larger magnitude pressure variations, corresponding to a large r 
CO 2 capacity ( Figure 2D ).  
For optimization  experiments, t he voltage  was limited to  –2 V to minimize any parasitic side 
reactions at large cell voltages . Degradation was seen to increase when a larger voltage range 
was used ( Figure S 12.1 and S 12.2) therefore a cell voltage window between -1 to -2 V was 
used . To optimize  the CO 2 capture capability of the electrode,  the current density was varied 
and a value  of 0.1 A g–1 was found to be slow enough for carbon dioxide to be captured by 
reduced anthraquinones  but fast enough to limit any additional  degradation of the cell  (Figure  
S13.1). Adsorption capacity values of around 0.4 mmol g–1 were seen  with an energy 
consumption of 256 kJ mol–1 (Section S14). This energy consumption is higher than  for the 
polyanthraquinone system developed by Vosk ian et al. , howeve r, the corresponding  
adsorption capacities were not reported for th at system.26 These capacities were comparable 
to the theoretical value for 1 equivalen t of CO 2 per anthraquinone molecule , calculated a s 0.46 
mmol g–1 from our estimated quinone loading (Sections S15 & S16). Previous anthra quinone 
capture systems were able to obtain a 1.5 CO 2: quinone ratio ,26 suggesting  there is potential 
to optimize f -CMK -3 to obtain higher CO 2 capacities . Other studies obtained an adsorption 
capacity of 5.9 mmol CO2 gAQ-1 which is comparable to our experimental value of 4.44  mmol CO2 
gAQ-1 assuming a quinone loading  of 9 wt.% . However , these literature values were only seen 
in the initial 50 cycles before the cell degraded. 24  
The electronic charge  stored was calculated from the electrochemistry  measurements, 
providing  information on the electrochemical behavio ur of f-CMK -3 under CO 2 (Section  S17, 
Figure S1 7.3). Electronic c harge values were approximately  1.0 mmol g–1 (i.e., 1.0 mmol of 
electrons per g ram of f-CMK -3)—much  higher than the CO 2 adsorption values. The F aradaic 
efficiency , the percentage of total charge extracted during cell discharge relative to during cell 
charging,  was seen to increase above 90% during cycling  (Figure S1 7.4). However, t he 
charge -capture efficiency  of the cell —i.e., the proportion of electronic charge s that were  used 
for CO 2 capture —was ca. 20% after cycl ing (Figure S1 7.4). In other words,  approximately 
80% of the electronic charge  stored is not utilized for CO 2 capture and is used for other 
processes , e.g., capacitive  and Faradaic  charging. A downward pressure slope was present 
in this limited voltage range  (Figure S 17.2), indicating some  degradation  may be taking place . 
Open circuit voltage (OCV) experiments were used to confirm no gas leakage in the system  
(Figures S 9.1, S10.1, S11.1 & 17.1). In the future, more stable quinone molecules  and carbon 
supports  could reduce the amount of degradation seen within the system.53  Further  experiments were r un between 0 to –2.5 V  with a 10 -minute voltage  hold after each 
cycle  to allow maximum adsorption (Figure 2D). From the initial cycles, f -CMK -3 had an 
adsorption capacity  of around 1 mmol g–1, which rapidly decreased upon cycling , presumably 
due to degradation  processes  (see below) .54,55 After the system began to stabilise, the 
adsorption  capacity leveled to around  0.4 mmol g–1, similar to what is seen for a limited cell 
voltage range of –1 to –2 V, but this larger voltage window proved more energy intensive, 
exhibiting  a higher energy co nsumption of 830 kJ mol–1. Additionally, a steeper  negative  
pressure slope  for this larger voltage window suggests increased material degradation (Figure 
S17.5). Observe electronic c harge values in the larger voltage window were around 2 .5 mmol 
g–1 and are larger than the adsorption values , indicating poorer Faradaic efficiency  (Figure 
S17.6 & S17.7). A charge -capture efficiency  of below  20 %  indicates a lower proportion of 
charge was used for CO 2 capture processes  compared to  the more limited voltage window  of 
–1 to –2 V. In summary, c arbon capture has been shown to be facilitated by the presence of 
anthraquinone on CMK -3 however degradation occurs even in limi ted potential windows.  
Interestingly, control experiments on the unfunctionalized carbon,  u-CMK -3, also show ed a 
small amount of reversible CO 2 capture with  an initial adsorption capacity of 0.15 mmol g–1  
when cycled within a −1 to −2 V window (Figure S 9.3), which is higher than what is seen 
under N 2 atmosphere  (Figure S 11.2). It can be assumed  that some redox -active functionalities 
are present on the u-CMK -3 surface, shown by a high oxygen content in elemental analysis  
and XPS (Table S6.1  and Table S 18.1).56 These functionalities are likely to only give broad 
features  in the CV experiments , indistinguishable from the double -layer capacitance , but may 
contribute to electrochemical CO 2 capture  when anthraquinone is not present.57 This 
unexpected electrochemical CO 2 adsorption  may also be due to the carbon electrode  
polarization causing enhanced CO 2 physisorption . This would not be seen under N 2 due to the 
lack of polarizability. The difference in adsorption capacity between f -CMK -3 and u -CMK -3 
was assigned to grafted anthraquinone —around 0.2 mmol g–1—confirming grafting of 
anthraquinone on CMK -3 improves carbon adsorption .  
Finally, l ong cycling studies were carried out between  –1 to –2 V to monitor  the cell 
degradation over 200 cycles (Figure 3A). Following initial  losses, the CO 2 adsorption capacity  
began to  stabilize around 0.2 mmol g–1. u-CMK -3 showed much smaller adsorption capacities, 
with n o overlap  seen  between u -CMK -3 and f -CMK -3 within error  (Figure 3A ). We hypothesize 
that some  anthraquinone was lost from f-CMK -3 during  cycling under CO 2. The loss of 
anthraquinone after CO 2 capture was further investigated using electrochemical techniques.  
The CV curve of f-CMK -3 showed a large decrease in Faradaic contribution with minimal loss 
to double -layer capacity  after 200 cycles  (Figure 3B). Anthraquinone  loading was recalculated to be 3.4 %; this account ed for the difference in  electronic charge of u-CMK -3 and f -CMK -3 
after 200 cycles. The lack of stability under CO 2 was not seen under an N2 atmosphere. When 
cycling up  to 3000 cycles , electronic charge capacity retention was  84% under N 2 whereas 
under CO 2 this was limited to  54% (Figure S20.1). The observed l ack of long-term stability 
could be due to an irreversible reaction between f -CMK -3 and CO 2. Figure 3C shows that the 
electronic charge values were maintained at around 1 mmol g–1 with Faradaic efficienc ies 
above 95 % after 200 cycles.  The charge -capture efficiency was slightly lower than the value 
of 20% observed in the above experiment ( Figure 2C), indicating degradation is still present 
in f-CMK -3 materials .  
The loss of electronic charge from anthraquinone degradation under CO 2 was investigated 
using 1H NMR  (Figure S21.1). After cycling, the ionic liquid electrolyte was collected and NMR 
spectra s howed the presence of the [bmim][TFSI] electrolyte  (as expected)  as well as some 
unknown aromatic peaks. These were compared to anthraquinone  (Figure S21.1), but could 
not be accurately assigned . This could suggest a small amount of anthraquinone ha s

account for a n electronic capacity loss of 28%, thus still allowing for the possibility that  some 
anthraquinone becom es electrochemically inacc essible after a reaction with CO 2. In the future, 
a full investigation of the factors determining stability in these systems will be carried out, so 
that more stable sorbents can be obtained.  Finally, we note that our materials are readily 
tunable since both the porous carbon and the redox -active support can be readily varied. 
Indeed,  we functionalised a second porous carbon which also showed evidence for 
electrochemical CO 2 capture ( Figure S 22.1).  
Conclusion and Outlo ok 
In this work we have developed  a new class of q uinone -functionalised carbon materials for 
electrochemically driven CO 2 capture. Structural characterization  and electrochemistry  
measurements showed that  anthraquinones were  successfully grafted to CMK -3 mes oporous 
carbon  using the diazonium radical reaction  to yield f -CMK -3. Following quinone 
functionalisation, clear increases in electrochemical charge storage capacity were obtained 
due to anthraquinone redox reactions.  By incorporating f -CMK -3 in an electrochemical gas 
cell and applying a cell voltage in the range of –1 to –2 V in the presence of CO 2, CO 2 
adsorption capacities ca. 0.4 mmol g–1 were demonstrated that  utilize the Faradaic redox 
reactions of anthraquinone on the carbon surface. The addition of anthraquinone  therefore  
improves both the carbon capture and energy storage abilities of the solid -state electrode.  
Upon cycling, however, a loss of carbon  dioxide  adsorption i s seen which could be due to  an 
irreversible reaction between anthraquinone and CO 2. Our facile synthesis method lends itself 
to the preparation of a large family of sorbents for electrochemical CO 2 capture. Indeed, the 
porous carbon support and the redox -active molecules can readily be varied to prepare a large 
family of materials . Research beyond the scope of this study  into the carbon -capture 
mechanism  within these systems is ongoing . Furthermore,  more work to investigate the 
efficienc y of electrochemical capture systems in more realistic conditions, in lower 
concentrations of CO 2, and in the presence of oxygen and moisture  need s to be carried out . 
These conditions have yet to be investigate d for this material but ha ve been carried out for 
other systems .15,58  In the future, we envisage that optimization of these materials will lead to 
higher electrochemical CO 2 capture capacities, as well as improved stability under operating 
conditio ns. Our work opens the door to studies of an entirely new class of materials for 
electrochemical CO 2 capture.
