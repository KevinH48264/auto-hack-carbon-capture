Among these negative emissions technologies,\ndirect air capture (DAC), in which CO 2is captured directly from the atmosphere, could play an\nimportant role. The captured CO 2can be removed in the long term and through its storage can be\nused for chemical processes, allowing closed carbon cycles in the short term. For DAC, different\ntechnologies have been suggested in the literature, and an overview of these is proposed in this work.\nAbsorption and adsorption are the most studied and mature technologies, but others are also under\ninvestigation. An analysis of the main key performance indicators is also presented here and it is\nsuggested that more efforts should be made to develop DAC at a large scale by reducing costs and\nimproving ef\ufb01ciency. An additional discussion, addressing the social concern, is indicated as well.\nKeywords: atmospheric CO 2; direct air capture; CO 2reduction; CO 2removal; key performance\nindicators; carbon capture technologies\n1. Introduction\nRecent estimates report that CO 2emissions in the world were more than 33 Gton in\n2018 [ 1]. In order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, several international agreements\nwere signed: the Conference of the Parties (COP21) held at Paris on the 12 December 2015\nwas a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\n2/1.5\u000eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was con\ufb01rmed\nby the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\nnational determined contribution (NDC) was de\ufb01ned [ 3]. However, in order to achieve this\nobjective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\nnot enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\nFor this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\nremoval (CDR) technologies, will have a crucial role in the coming years to achieve the\nCO 2level de\ufb01ned by the environmental agreements and stabilize the CO 2concentration\nbetween 350 and 440 ppm [6,7].\nNegative emissions technologies are de\ufb01ned as the intentional human effort to remove\nCO 2emissions from the atmosphere and include the following: afforestation and reforesta-\ntion (AR), soil carbon sequestration (SCS), biochar (BC), bioenergy with carbon capture and\nstorage (BECCS), direct air capture (DAC), enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization\n(EW) and ocean fertilization (OF) [ 8]. Among these solutions, the research community has\nbeen focused for the most part on DAC, due to its advantages [9].\nDAC was used for decades to produce CO 2-free air to support life in submarines and\nspacecraft systems [ 10,11]; it was presented by Lackner as a GHG mitigation technology\nonly in 1999 [ 12]. DAC captures CO 2from the atmosphere to store it as part of a CDR\nprocess in the long term (direct air carbon capture and storage\u2014DACCS). Integrated\nDAC systems have also been studied to supply climate-neutral CO 2for chemical processes\nAppl.

DAC is independent of CO 2source location,\nbecause CO 2is distributed homogeneously throughout the atmosphere, minimizing or\neliminating CO 2transportation costs when the capture plant is situated near the utilization\nor storage site [ 16]; the capture plant can be located in a particular place where the the re-\nnewable energy can be exploited at the minimum cost [ 17]; DAC can tackle emissions from\nthe transport sector and other small sources that constitute about 50% of total emissions; air\nis ubiquitous, with few contaminants that could cause the degradation of solvents/sorbents\n(e.g., NO x, SO xand particulates) [18]; arable land is not required, avoiding loss of agricul-\ntural land [ 9]; the technology contributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development\nGoals (SDGs) 13, 9, 6 (by-product water could be used as fresh water in general), 8 (creation\nof new green jobs), 7 (exploitation of renewable energies), 11 and 12 (production of fuels\nand materials from atmospheric CO 2) and 3 (positive effect on health) [ 17]. However, there\nare also some disadvantages: the long term storage and sequestration of CO 2are critical\n(costs, long-term monitoring, potentially induced seismicity and leakage) [ 19]; low CO 2\npartial pressure in the air, about 400 ppm, 350 times lower than coal \ufb02ue gas so that large\nvolumes of air should be processed to capture a signi\ufb01cant amount of CO 2[7,13,20]; high\nenergy and cost requirements due to the dilute nature of CO 2in the air, requiring a large\nvolume of air to be treated [21].\nDAC technologies include absorption, adsorption, ion exchange resin, mineral car-\nbonation, membrane, photocatalysis, cryogenic separation, electrochemical approach and\nelectrodialysis approaches [ 6,18,22\u201326]. Absorption and adsorption technologies are the\nmost analyzed and studied in the literature [18].\nDAC technologies are characterized by thermodynamic issues related to the separation\nof CO 2from the air, which are more signi\ufb01cant than in the separation of CO 2from the \ufb02ue\ngas [ 27].

DAC Technologies\nIn this section, an overview of DAC technologies is set forth. Absorption, adsorption,\nion exchange resin, mineral carbonation, membrane, photocatalysis, cryogenic separation,\nelectrochemical and electrodialysis approaches are investigated.Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 8321 4 of 41\n2.1. Absorption\nIn absorption technology for DAC, water solutions of strong bases containing hydrox-\nide sorbents with a strong CO 2af\ufb01nity, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium\nhydroxide (KOH) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2), are used [ 3]. The absorption with\nCa(OH) 2was proposed by Lackner et al. [ 12] and it follows the reactions described be-\nlow [18] (see Equations (2)\u2013(4)):\nCa(OH)2+CO 2!CaCO 3+H2ODH25\u000eC=\u0000109 kJ/mol (2)\nCaCO 3!CaO +CO 2DH900\u000eC= + 179.2 kJ/mol (3)\nCaO +H2O!Ca(OH)2DH\u000e\n100\u000eC=\u000064.5 kJ/mol (4)\nThe reaction starts with calcium hydroxide and CO 2to form calcium carbonate\n(CaCO 3). The obtained calcium carbonate is precipitated, accumulated, separated from\nwater, dried and calcined above 900\u000eC. In this step, calcium oxide (CaO) and CO 2(con-\ncentrated stream) are obtained. Afterwards, calcium oxide is hydrated to produce calcium\nhydroxide. This reaction scheme allows a closed cycle. However, there are some disadvan-\ntages to this process, such as the great amount of lost water, high temperatures and high\nrequired energies for the calcination step (179.2 kJ/mol), and the low solubility of calcium\nhydroxide in water, which limits the hydroxide concentration for CO 2capture [3,18].\nThe use of NaOH water solution was proposed by Baciocchi et al. [ 37] and has a\nsimilarity to the Kraft process used in the paper industry to extract cellulose from wood.\nCompared to Ca(OH) 2, NaOH solution allows a strong binding of CO 2but with a higher\nsolubility of carbonate in water. In this process, there are two cycles working simultaneously.\nIn the \ufb01rst, CO 2is captured by NaOH to produce sodium carbonate (Na 2CO 3) in the\nabsorber through an exothermic reaction evolving at ambient temperature and pressure (see\nEquation (5)). In the second cycle, known as the regeneration cycle, NaOH is regenerated\nin the causticizer/precipitator: Na 2CO 3reacts with Ca(OH) 2to produce NaOH and CaCO 3\n(see Equation (6)). From calcium carbonate, CO 2(concentrated stream) is recovered in the\ncalciner/kiln (see Equation (7)) and receives oxygen (O 2) from an air separation unit. As\nmentioned above, this step requires a lot of energy, with temperatures above 900\u000eC to\nallow the removal of water and decomposition of CaCO 3. Afterwards, CaO is hydrated to\nCa(OH) 2in the slaker (see Equation (8)) so that it can be sent to the precipitator to be used\nagain [18]. Figure 3 shows the scheme of this process.\nAbsorber 2Na(OH)+CO 2!Na2CO 3+H2ODH25\u000eC=\u0000109.4 kJ/mol (5)\nCausticizer Na 2CO 3+Ca(OH)2!2Na(OH)+CaCO 3DH100\u000eC=\u00005.3 kJ/mol (6)\nCalciner CaCO 3!CaO +CO 2DH900\u000eC= + 179.2 kJ/mol (7)\nSlaker CaO +H2O!Ca(OH)2DH100\u000eC=\u000064.5 kJ/mol (8)Appl.

Zeman [42] estimated that 90 gH 2O/gCO 2 captured are lost. \nOn the other hand, Stolaroff et al. [43] found that water losses can be reduced by increas-\ning the NaOH concentration to 7 M. However,  by increasing the NaOH concentration,  the \nsolution becomes more viscous and more aggressive , and it is more difficult to ha ndle \neven if the capture reaction is favored [31].  \n \nFigure 3 . Process scheme for the DAC absorption process with NaOH aqueous solution. Repro-\nduced under the Standard ACS AuthorChoice/Editors\u2019 Choice Usage Agreement [18] . \nAn alternative to NaOH and Ca(OH) 2 solutions is KOH solution, which has lower \nlevels of regeneration , though  it is more expensive , so that few studies involving it are \npresent in the literature [18,44]. The choice of a particular solution is a critical point: the \nsolution should be strong enough to capture a significant amount of CO 2 from the dilute \nair but at the same time weak enough to release CO 2 during the regeneration  stage . En-\nzymes can be added to the solution as catalysts in order to increase the absorption rate of CO\n2 [45]. However, problems related to pH, temperature limits and organic decay can \noccur [46].  \nThis DAC capture technology  has i mportant design characteristics. In fact, absorp-\ntion columns are short and have a large cross section due to the dilute nature of CO 2; they \nare different from traditional packed towers [47]. Moreover, as a large volume of air is processed, pressure drop should be limited [18]. In addition to packed towers, spray tow-ers or open stagnant pools can be used [44,47]. The spray tower provides a large surface \narea for air\u2013 liquid contact, with a low pressure drop. In this configuration, the costs of \nlarge , packed towers are also avoided but the use of a spray causes energy losses [43]. \nAnother problem for this kind of absorber is related to coalesc ence , which should be re-\nduced by reducing the flow rate and the CO\n2 capture rate.  \nIn order to improve the process and overcome its limitations for the regeneration of \nNaOH, alternative causticization reactions have been suggested , such as autocausticiza-\ntion and direct causticization [18]. In the first case, sodium metaborate (NaBO 2) is used , \ninvolving the following reactions [18] (see Eq uation s (9)\u2013(12)):  \n2\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc422+\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc362\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc423 \u2192\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc364\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc352\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc425+\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc422 (9) \n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc364\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc352\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc425+\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc422\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42 \u21922\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42 +2\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc422  (10) \n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc422+\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc362\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc423 \u2192\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc363\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc423+\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc422  (11) \n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc363\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc423 +\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc422\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42 \u2192\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc42 +\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc422   (12) \nIn this case, the reaction product is water -soluble , removing the need for drying or \nthe movement of solids [48]. However, this requires a lot of energy, as temperatures are \nhigher than 900 \u00b0C.  \nFigure 3. Process scheme for the DAC absorption process with NaOH aqueous solution. Reproduced\nunder the Standard ACS AuthorChoice/Editors\u2019 Choice Usage Agreement [18].\nAn energy calculation showed that the energy for the calcination (179.2 kJ/mol) is well\nabove the calculated thermodynamic minimum for the absorption stage ( \u0000109.4 kJ/mol):\na high energy requirement is still present [ 41]. In fact, strong binds are present within\nthe CaCO 3molecules [ 3]. In addition to this high energy requirement, the water loss\n(water before calcination in the calciner must be removed) is an additional disadvantage\nof the process. Zeman [ 42] estimated that 90 gH 2O/gCO 2captured are lost. On the\nother hand, Stolaroff et al. [ 43] found that water losses can be reduced by increasing the\nNaOH concentration to 7 M. However, by increasing the NaOH concentration, the solution\nbecomes more viscous and more aggressive, and it is more dif\ufb01cult to handle even if the\ncapture reaction is favored [31].\nAn alternative to NaOH and Ca(OH) 2solutions is KOH solution, which has lower\nlevels of regeneration, though it is more expensive, so that few studies involving it are\npresent in the literature [ 18,44]. The choice of a particular solution is a critical point: the\nsolution should be strong enough to capture a signi\ufb01cant amount of CO 2from the dilute air\nbut at the same time weak enough to release CO 2during the regeneration stage. Enzymes\ncan be added to the solution as catalysts in order to increase the absorption rate of CO 2[45].\nHowever, problems related to pH, temperature limits and organic decay can occur [46].\nThis DAC capture technology has important design characteristics. In fact, absorption\ncolumns are short and have a large cross section due to the dilute nature of CO 2; they\nare different from traditional packed towers [ 47]. Moreover, as a large volume of air is\nprocessed, pressure drop should be limited [ 18]. In addition to packed towers, spray towers\nor open stagnant pools can be used [ 44,47]. The spray tower provides a large surface area\nfor air\u2013liquid contact, with a low pressure drop. In this con\ufb01guration, the costs of large,\npacked towers are also avoided but the use of a spray causes energy losses [ 43]. Another\nproblem for this kind of absorber is related to coalescence, which should be reduced by\nreducing the \ufb02ow rate and the CO 2capture rate.\nIn order to improve the process and overcome its limitations for the regeneration of\nNaOH, alternative causticization reactions have been suggested, such as autocausticiza-\ntion and direct causticization [ 18]. In the \ufb01rst case, sodium metaborate (NaBO 2) is used,\ninvolving the following reactions [18] (see Equations (9)\u2013(12)):\n2NaBO 2+Na2CO 3!Na4B2O5+CO 2 (9)\nNa4B2O5+H2O!2NaOH +2NaBO 2 (10)\nNaBO 2+Na2CO 3!Na3BO3+CO 2 (11)\nNa3BO3+H2O!NaOH +NaBO 2 (12)Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 8321 6 of 41\nIn this case, the reaction product is water-soluble, removing the need for drying or the\nmovement of solids [ 48]. However, this requires a lot of energy, as temperatures are higher\nthan 900\u000eC.\nIn direct causticization, the reaction product is not water-soluble and these reactions\ninvolve titanium dioxide (see Equations (13)\u2013(16)) [18]:\n7Na2CO 3(s)+5(Na2O\u00013TiO 2)!3(4Na2O\u00015TiO)+7CO 2DH850\u000eC=90 kJ/mol (13)\nNa2CO 3(s)!Na2CO 3(l)DH850\u000eC=25 kJ/mol (14)\n7Na2CO 3(l)+5(Na2O\u00013TiO 2)!3(4Na2O\u00015TiO)+7CO 2DH850\u000eC=65 kJ/mol (15)\n3(4Na2O\u00015TiO)+7H2O!5(Na2O\u00013TiO 2)+14NaOH DH100\u000eC=15 kJ/mol (16)\nThe disadvantages are that the heat requirement is comparable to that of an aqueous\namine-based liquid post-combustion CO 2capture process (130 kJ/molCO 2) and more\nprocessing steps are needed in comparison with the traditional causticizer process [48].\nStudies in the literature are mostly concerned with economic and energetic anal-\nysis and process design. Regarding energetic analysis, it needs to be underlined that,\nin addition to heat, electrical energy is required for fans to blow air through the con-\ntactor, to spray the aqueous solution and to move the solution between each piece of\nequipment. Fasihi et al. [ 49] reported that the electrical energy requirement is in a range\nbetween 366 kWh/tonCO 2and 764 kWh/tonCO 2(including energy for CO 2compres-\nsion), while the thermal energy requirement is in a range between 1420 kWh/tonCO 2\nand 2780 kWh/tonCO 2. A process design and an energy evaluation have been carried\nout by Baciocchi et al. [ 37] and it was found that 1678 kWh/tonCO 2was required for\nthe thermal energy, while 440 kWh/tonCO 2was needed for the electrical energy for the\ncomplete absorption process using NaOH. Zeman [ 41] found that the energy requirement\nfor a packed tower contactor was 555 kWh/tonCO 2, but he suggested that the use of hollow\n\ufb01ber membranes as packing could reduce this to 361 kWh/tonCO 2(33% lower). A detailed\nsimulation in Aspen Plus of the complete process, shown in Figure 4, was carried out\nby Keith et al. [ 34] for the \ufb01rst time. Using a KOH solution, the authors found that to\ndeliver CO 2at 15 Mpa, 1458 kWh/tonCO 2of natural gas would be required, in addition to\n366 kWh/tonCO 2of electric energy. A large-scale plant captures about 1 MtonCO 2/year\nand the levelized cost ranges between 94 and 232 $/tonCO 2.\nAppl.

[ 51], comparing\ndifferent packings, found that the optimized cost ranged from 518 $/tCO 2for M-CC to\n568 $/tCO 2for M-250Y, making it a non-competitive mitigation system. A lower cost was\nfound by Stolaroff [ 52] in studying a complete plant with a contactor using a spray for\nNaOH solution: the cost range was between 80 $/tonCO 2and 250 $/tonCO 2. In the work\nof Fasihi et al. [ 49], the expected cost for this kind of technology was reported for the 2040\nand 2050. In the \ufb01rst case, costs were in a range between 70 \u00a0/tonCO 2and 90 \u00a0/tonCO 2,\nwhile, in the second case, costs decreased and were in a range between 55 \u00a0/tonCO 2and\n70\u00a0/tonCO 2.\nSome experimental works have also been presented. Holmes et al. [ 53] built an\nabsorber prototype for the Carbon Engineering company to test the cross \ufb02ow and PVC\npacking, to evaluate energy requirements and fouling by atmospheric particulates and to\nassess technical and safety risks.\n2.2. Adsorption\nWhile the absorption process mainly uses an aqueous solution of NaOH, KOH or\nCa(OH) 2, the adsorption process is based on the chemical or physical adsorption of CO 2\nwith particular sorbents, such as amine-functionalized sorbents, metal organic frameworks\n(MOFs), zeolites, etc. [6]. Among chemisorbents, amine-functionalized sorbents and solid\nalkali carbonates sorbents (bulk and supported) have been proposed, while, among ph-\nysisorbents, MOFs, zeolites and new materials, such as boron nitride nanosheets and\nnanotubes, have been investigated [ 18]. Amine-functionalized sorbents have received sig-\nni\ufb01cant attention for DAC systems due to their stability under humidity, low regeneration\ntemperatures (50\u2013120\u000eC) and \ufb02exibility in the choice of low-cost support [39].\nGenerally, in the adsorption system, a single equipment unit is used, where adsorption\nand desorption happen alternately after variations in temperature or pressure or a combi-\nnation of the two. Generally, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is not practicable in a real\nprocess because a pressure lower than 0.4 mbar is required. At lab scale, the temperature\nswing adsorption (TSA) is generally used, but the use of an inert gas purge results in\na dilute output stream. On the other hand, temperature and vacuum swing adsorption\n(TVSA) could be used to produce a high-CO 2purity stream.\nMost studies reported in the literature on the adsorption process are on the investigation\nof sorbents, evaluating adsorption capacities and performances, as discussed below.\n2.2.1. Physisorbents\nPhysisorption occurs between the sorbent surface and CO 2, allowing only a physical\ninteraction. Generally, materials with porosity or nanometric dimensions, such as zeolites,\nactivated carbon, MOFs and new materials, have been considered [ 54]. Activated carbons\nare characterized by low cost and high thermal stability, showing an adsorption capacity\nand selectivity lower than that of zeolites at a low CO 2partial pressure but higher at a high\nCO 2partial pressure [ 55,56]. For this reason, activated carbons are not a good choice for\ndirect air capture [6].\nFactors in\ufb02uencing the CO 2capture of zeolites are size, charge density and distribution\nof cations in the porous structure [ 57]. Humidity has a negative effect on CO 2capture, and\nfor this reason zeolites are not suggested for direct air capture [6].\nMOFs are characterized by \ufb02exibility in shape, pore structure, pore size and surface\nproperties [ 58]. Similar to activated carbons, adsorption capacity and selectivity are lower\nat low CO 2partial pressures and in the presence of humidity; MOFs are suitable for CO 2\nstorage and not for CO 2separation. However, in recent years, attention has been directed\nto MOFs (particularly MIL-101(Cr)) functionalized with amine (adsorption of amines onto\nmetal sites or physical impregnation with liquid amines) which provide better performances\nfor CO 2capture from the air due to their durability under moist conditions [ 39]. Currently,\nthe high cost of MOFs makes their use in DAC prohibitive [6].Appl.

These materials have the ability to capture\nCO 2from the air due to the introduction of electrons and to spontaneously desorb CO 2\nwhen electrons are removed.\nGenerally, adsorption with physisorbents is characterized by a low adsorption capacity\ndue to the dilute concentration of CO 2in the air and the negative effect of moisture.

In this case, amines have\na low molecular weight and are easily leached during the adsorption and regeneration\nprocesses. Class II includes sorbents where amines are chemically grafted onto the surface\nsupport. Due to a higher amine content, class I has a higher adsorption capacity than class\nII. Class III consists of an inorganic support and a chemically grafted polyamine component\nthat is prepared through the in situ polymerization of amine-containing monomers. This\nclass has an adsorption capacity higher than that of sorbents of class II due to the higher\nnumber of amines and excellent regeneration capacity. Generally, classes II and III are more\nsuitable for DAC because the amine is chemically bound on the support and this reduces\nvolatilization problems during regeneration and adsorption cycles.\nAppl.

In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2\u2013 redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ\u25cf\u2013/ TCQ2\u2212)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak\u2013peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(\u0394E1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry\u2019s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\nTerms & Conditions\nMost electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.

Alan Hatton4 & Haotian Wang1,2,5\u2009\u2709\nElectrochemical carbon-capture technologies, with renewable electricity as the \nenergy input, are promising for carbon management but still suffer from low capture \nrates, oxygen sensitivity or system complexity1\u20136. Here we demonstrate a continuous \nelectrochemical carbon-capture design by coupling oxygen/water (O2/H2O) redox \ncouple with a modular solid-electrolyte reactor7. By performing oxygen reduction \nreaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) redox electrolysis, our device can efficiently absorb dilute carbon dioxide (CO\n2) molecules at the high-alkaline \ncathode\u2013membrane interface to form carbonate ions, followed by a neutralization process through the proton flux from the anode to continuously output a high-purity \n(>99%) CO\n2 stream from the middle solid-electrolyte layer. No chemical inputs were \nneeded nor side products generated during the whole carbon absorption/release \nprocess. High carbon-capture rates (440\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122, 0.137\u2009mmolCO2\u2009min\u22121\u2009cm\u22122 or \n86.7\u2009kgCO2\u2009day\u22121\u2009m\u22122), high Faradaic efficiencies (>90% based on carbonate), high \ncarbon-removal efficiency (>98%) in simulated flue gas and low energy consumption (starting from about 150\u2009kJ per mol\nCO2) were demonstrated in our carbon-capture \nsolid-electrolyte reactor, suggesting promising practical applications.\nCO2 capture from dilute sources, ranging from industrial waste gas \nto atmosphere, plays an increasingly important role in managing \nglobal CO2 emissions and promoting downstream CO2 storage and \nuse1,3,8,9. Existing carbon-capture technologies (such as the amine \nscrubbing and Ca(OH)2/CaCO3/CaO+CO2 cycling process) typically \nrely on an energy-intensive and centralized thermal cycling process, \nin which elevated temperatures (as high as 900\u2009\u00b0C in the case of CaCO3 \ndecomposition) are needed to release the absorbed CO2 (refs.\u200910 \u201312). \nOther carbon-capture methods that use solid sorbents with high \nporosity and surface area, such as metal\u2013organic frameworks, have \nshown promising capture capacities but inferior cycling stability, \nespecially when exposed to humidity13\u2013 15. Although electrochemical \ncarbon-capture methods have gained attention as appealing alterna -\ntives owing to their high energy efficiency, decentralized operation, \nambient reaction conditions and ability to use renewable electricity, \nsubstantial challenges must be addressed before they can be widely \nimplemented3\u20135,16\u201318.\nIn general, electrochemical carbon capture relies on either \nredox-active carriers or pH swing to absorb and release CO2. The \nredox-active carriers, such as quinones, have high energy efficiency \nowing to their facile reaction kinetics involved in binding and releasing \nCO2 molecules under reduced and oxidized states19,20. However, their \npractical applications are still limited by low capture rates (typically \n<10\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122) and sensitivity to O2 gas present in most CO2 sources. On \nthe other hand, pH-swing methods using salt or water electrolysis to separate alkaline and acidic solutions, for CO2 absorption followed by \nacidification to release CO2, have been reported to be insensitive to O2 \nand can deliver larger currents (about 100\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122)2,18 ,21,22. However, \nthe decoupling of the electrolysis process from the CO2 absorption \nprocess requires energy-intensive downstream gas\u2013liquid contacting \nprocesses, especially under low CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, \nby-products such as H2 (from water splitting)23 or Cl2 (from NaCl elec-\ntrolysis)24,25 generated in different pH-swing designs add complexity \nand challenges to decentralized carbon capture.\nHere we report a different carbon-capture design by coupling O2/\nH2O electrolysis with our porous solid-electrolyte (PSE) reactor7 for a \ncontinuous and modular CO2 capture from a wide range of CO2 sources \nat industrially relevant capture rate, high energy efficiency, no O2 sen -\nsitivity and easy scalability and adaptability. As shown in Fig.\u00a01a, our \nsolid-electrolyte reactor comprises an ORR (O2\u2009+\u20092H2O\u2009+\u20094e\u2212\u2009=\u20094OH\u2212) \ncathode and an OER (2H2O\u2009=\u2009O2\u2009+\u20094H+\u2009+\u20094e\u2212) anode, which are sepa -\nrated by a compact, but porous, solid-electrolyte layer to allow effi -\ncient ion conduction (Supplementary Fig.\u00a01). By performing this OER/\nORR redox electrolysis, the system does not consume or produce any \nchemicals, as the generated O2 from the anode can be recycled back \nto the cathode for a stoichiometric balance. To avoid flooding, an \nanion-exchange membrane (AEM) and a cation-exchange membrane \n(CEM) are inserted between the electrodes and the PSE layer. When \nO2 molecules get reduced by an active ORR catalyst (such as commer-\ncial Pt/C) on the cathode, large numbers of hydroxide ions (OH\u2212) are https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06060-1\nReceived: 1 May 2022\nAccepted: 6 April 2023\nPublished online: 28 June 2023\n Check for updates\n1Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA. 2Department of Materials Science and NanoEngineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA. \n3Canadian Light Source Inc., University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. 4Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, \nUSA. 5Department of Chemistry, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA. 6These authors contributed equally: Peng Zhu, Zhen-Yu Wu. \u2709e-mail: htwang@rice.edu960  | Nature | Vol 618 | 29 June 2023\nArticlegenerated at the catalyst\u2013membrane interface, which react rapidly \nwith the CO2 molecules in the stream to form carbonate or bicarbonate \nions (Fig.\u00a0 1b). These carbonate ions, driven by the electric field, then \nmigrate across the AEM into the PSE layer. Meanwhile, water on the \nanode side is oxidized to generate the same amount of O2 that gets \nconsumed and releases protons (H+) that travel across the CEM into \nthe middle layer to compensate the charge. These crossover carbonate \nand proton ions are recombined to form CO2 gas again, which can be \ncontinuously pushed out and collected in its high-purity form through \na recycling water flow through the PSE layer (Fig.\u00a0 1c).\nOur solid-electrolyte carbon-capture design presents several advan -\ntages over reported electrochemical carbon-capture methods. First, \nunlike some redox-active carriers that can be poisoned by the coexist -\ning O2 gas6, our proposed system fully uses O2 through ORR to create \na strong interfacial alkaline environment for effective CO2 capture26. \nSecond, there are no specific chemical inputs (other than water) or \nconsumption during the capture process, as the device performs ORR/\nOER redox electrolysis. Third, the triple-phase boundary created at \nthe cathode of our solid-electrolyte reactor allows for rapid diffu -\nsion of CO2 in the gas phase towards the catalyst\u2013membrane inter -\nface26\u201328, enabling the reactor to operate under large current densities \nfor fast CO2 capture while still maintaining high Faradaic efficiencies. \nThis is different from the traditional pH-swing method, in which the \nliquid-phase mass diffusion limits the rates of CO2 adsorption (through \ngas\u2013liquid contact). Fourth, the capture system can take advantage \nof past advancements in fuel cells and water-splitting catalysts for \nhigh energy efficiencies and easy scalability. Finally, our PSE device \nenables a continuous, simultaneous and integrated carbon-capture \nand release process, which differs from traditional absorption/desorp -\ntion cycles and simplifies the carbon-capture system for many on-site \napplications (Fig.\u00a0 1d).Concept verification\nTo validate the proposed CO2-capture mechanism, we used commercial \nPt/C and IrO2 as the electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, respectively29. \nDifferent CO2:O2 ratios were used to establish a fundamental under -\nstanding of the intrinsic CO2-separation performance of the system \n(Methods and Supplementary Figs.\u00a02 and 3). As shown in Fig.\u00a02a, the \nORR/OER I\u2013V curves under different CO2 concentrations were similar, \nsuggesting that the O2 concentration instead of the CO2 concentration \ndetermines the cell activity. The onset potential (under 0.5\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122) \nis around 0.8\u2009V, including OER and ORR overpotentials (around 200\u2013\n300\u2009mV each), ohmic drops and pH overpotentials during electrolysis3. \nUnder high current density, at which O2 mass diffusion starts to affect \nORR activity, the I \u2013V curve (without iR compensations; Supplementary \nFig.\u00a04) of 4.6%\u2009CO2 showed slightly better cell voltage than that of 8.6% \nor 13.9% owing to its higher O2 partial pressure.\nUnder a constant ORR/OER electrolysis current, we can obtain the \nCO2-capture rate, which is equivalent to the CO2 crossover rate, by meas -\nuring the CO2 flow rate out of the PSE layer using water-displacement \nand titration methods for both the gas-phase and dissolved CO2 \n(Methods and Supplementary Figs.\u00a05\u20137). This CO2 dissolution can be \navoided in practical operations by continuously recycling the deion -\nized water stream. The CO2 bubble formation within the PSE layer \nwas found to have little impact on the middle-layer pressure or the \ndevice operational stability (Supplementary Fig.\u00a08). Furthermore, the \nrecovered gas product was confirmed to be high-purity CO2 through \ngas chromatography analysis (up to 99.7% without considering water \nvapour; Supplementary Fig.\u00a09), allowing for direct integration with \ndownstream utilization or storage processes without the typical \nenergy-intensive secondary purification processes.

This \nconclusion is supported by the well-matched CO2-capture rates with \nthe theoretical guideline, which assumes 100% carbonate crossover \nand is consistent with observations reported in previous studies5,16,18,30. \nTherefore, here we defined the carbonate Faradaic efficiency (FEcarbon -\nate) to better evaluate the carbon-capture efficiencies under different \nreaction conditions (Methods). The FEcarbonate  was maintained over 90% \nacross a wide range of cell currents under 13.9%\u2009CO2, suggesting a high \nutilization efficiency of generated OH\u2212 ions. However, at high current densities, FEcarbonate  showed a slight decrease owing to the competition \nbetween the rate of carbonate formation and OH\u2212 migration. There \nwere sufficient CO2 molecules around the catalyst\u2013membrane interface \nat low current densities to react rapidly with the generated OH\u2212 ions \nbefore they were transported across the membrane by means of car -\nbonate ions form. For high ORR currents, a large number of OH\u2212 ions  \nwere generated, depleting the surrounding CO2 molecules at a fast rate. \nThis limits the mass diffusion of CO2 and allows some OH\u2212 ions to move \ndirectly across the AEM without reacting with CO2 molecules, resulting \nin lowered FEs. Even with lower FEcarbonate , our solid-electrolyte reactor \ndelivered an impressive carbon-capture rate of 3.34\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121\u2009cm\u22122 (or \n0.137\u2009mmolCO2\u2009min\u22121\u2009cm\u22122) at 500\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122, which is equivalent to a rate \nof about 86.7\u2009kg\u2009CO2\u2009day\u22121\u2009m\u22122. According to the reaction mechanism \ndiscussed above, we can anticipate that the maximal current density \nrequired to maintain high FEs would decrease with decreasing CO2 \nconcentrations in the input gas owing to limited mass diffusion.

The error bars represent at least \nthree independent tests.962 | Nature | Vol 618 | 29 June 2023\nArticlewas confirmed by the 8.6% and 4.6%\u2009CO2 tests, in which the maxi -\nmal operation current to maintain over 80% FEcarbonate  decreased to \n400\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 and 200\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122, respectively (Fig.\u00a0 2c,d). Please note that \nthe choice of ion conduction in the solid electrolyte plays a critical role \nin determining the cell voltage, particularly under high current density  \n(Supplementary Fig.\u00a011).\nIn principle, because ORR catalysis and CO2 capture are independent \nprocesses, the O2 partial pressure should only affect the cell activity and \nnot its carbon-capture rates or FEs3,4. As shown by the I\u2013V curve com-\nparison in Fig.\u00a0 2e, the solid-electrolyte reactor with air\u2009+\u200913.9%\u2009CO2 pre -\nsented similar ORR/OER electrolysis activities to that of O2\u2009+\u200913.9%\u2009CO2 \nat low currents, but required higher voltages at higher currents owing \nto its lower O2 partial pressure. However, this cell-voltage difference \ndid not affect the current efficiencies or CO2-capture rates (Fig.\u00a0 2f and \nSupplementary Figs.\u00a012 and 13). To further test the carbon-capture \ncapability and adaptability of our solid-electrolyte device, we lowered \nthe feed CO2 levels to 6,200 and 2,950\u2009ppm while evaluating the cell \nperformance (Supplementary Fig.\u00a014). At low CO2 concentrations, the \nmain limitation to the carbon-capture rate is the mass transport of \nCO2 from the inlet flow to the catalyst\u2013membrane interface, which is \na common challenge for scaling up of all carbon-capture methods. As \nshown in Fig.\u00a0 2g, the CO2-capture efficiency was maintained above 80% \nwithin the current range 1\u201310\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 but rapidly decreased to around \n50\u201360% when reaching 20\u201330\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122. This FE decrease is because of \nthe mass-transfer limit of CO2 gas under this low-concentration condi -\ntion, which became more prominent when the input CO2 concentration \nwas further reduced to 2,950\u2009ppm (Fig.\u00a0 2h). In this case, the FEcarbonate  \ndecreased to about 55% under 10\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 current compared with 90% \nin the case of 6,200\u2009ppm. The observed FE trends imply that the opera -\ntional current of the carbon-capture cell can be adjusted to suit different \napplication scenarios, depending on the input CO2 concentrations, \nwhile still maintaining high electron efficiencies.\nIn practical scenarios, CO impurities are widely present in industrial \nflue gas owing to incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, which \ncould greatly affect the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst because \nof poisoning effects31,32. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 2i, the cell voltage under a \nfixed current of 100\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 showed an immediate increase when a CO \nstream was mixed with the cathode gas input and continuously rose by \nabout 300\u2009mV within 10\u2009h operation, suggesting a fast degradation of \nPt/C ORR activity. The impurity poisoning effects on the Pt catalyst, as \nwell as Pt scarcity and high cost, could limit the practical application \nof our solid-electrolyte carbon-capture device.\nThe impacts of different ORR catalysts\nOne unique advantage of our carbon-capture device is the flexibility \nin using different ORR and OER catalysts. Replacing the expensive \nPt/C noble-metal catalyst with earth-abundant ORR catalysts can sub -\nstantially reduce the materials cost; alternative ORR catalysts with \ndifferent material properties could help mitigate the CO poisoning \neffect observed on Pt/C. One promising candidate is the recently devel-\noped transition-metal single-atom catalyst (SAC), such as Fe or Co \nsingle-atomic sites coordinated in N-doped carbon33,34. These SACs \npresented similar ORR performance to commercial Pt/C with high \nresistance to CO poisoning owing to the weak interaction between CO \nand the transition-metal centre35. Here we used Co-SAC as a representa -\ntive ORR catalyst to investigate these possible advantages compared \nwith Pt/C. Our Co-SAC was synthesized on the basis of a hard-template \nmethod developed in our previous study, which guarantees high poros -\nity and uniform distribution of metal single-atomic sites on the carbon \nmatrix36 (Methods). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and \nother characterization tools suggest an interconnected 3D porous \nstructure of Co-SAC reversely templating from the SiO2 nanoparticle \ntemplates (Fig.\u00a03a and Supplementary Figs.\u00a015\u201318). X-ray absorption \nspectroscopy (XAS) confirmed the atomic dispersion of Co as shown in Fig.\u00a03b,c, in which only the Co\u2013N coordination (located at around \n1.4\u2009\u00c5) was observed in the spectrum and no Co\u2013Co interactions (about \n2.15\u2009\u00c5)37.\nWe first evaluated the carbon-capture performance of our Co-SAC \nunder a standard 13.9%\u2009CO2 concentration. The I \u2013V curve showed a \nsimilar catalytic activity and FEcarbonate  compared with Pt/C catalyst \n(Fig.\u00a03d and Supplementary Figs.\u00a019\u201321), suggesting the feasibility of \nreplacing Pt/C noble-metal catalyst with earth-abundant materials. \nDifferences became evident when we tuned the CO2 concentration \nto 6,200\u2009ppm, at which mass transport plays a more critical role in \ndetermining carbon-capture performance. As shown in Fig.\u00a0 3e, the \nCo-SAC maintained a high FE of more than 80% until 20\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122, \nunder which the Pt/C counterpart only achieved roughly 60% FE. \nThe carbon-capture rate of Co-SAC was 0.12\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121\u2009cm\u22122 under \n20\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122, suggesting a more than 30% improvement compared with \nPt/C (about 0.09\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121\u2009cm\u22122). The improvement ratio was further \nenhanced to around 50% under 30\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122. Our Co-SAC can deliver \n40\u2009mA\u2009m\u22122 current density with 60% FE and a carbon-capture rate of \n0.18\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121\u2009cm\u22122 or 4.8\u2009kgCO2\u2009day\u22121\u2009m\u22122, suggesting a highly efficient \ncarbon capture considering this low-CO2-concentration source. Differ -\nent from Pt/C catalyst with the active sites densely packed on the surface \nof Pt nanoparticles, Co-SAC has uniformly dispersed active sites across \nthe whole carbon matrix, which enables a more uniform generation of \nOH\u2212 ions for a more efficient CO2 capture, especially when the CO2 mass \ndiffusion is limited (Supplementary Fig.\u00a022). We further explored our \nCo-SAC and PSE device carbon-capture limit by testing its direct air \ncapture (DAC) performance (400\u2009ppm CO2; Methods). As expected, the \nORR current density to maintain high FEcarbonate  was decreased because \nof the limited carbon mass diffusions under DAC conditions (Supple-\nmentary Fig.\u00a023). Our reactor delivered almost 100% FEcarbonate  under \na 0.5\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 ORR current. This represents a carbon-capture rate of \n1.14\u2009mg\u2009m\u22122\u2009s\u22121, comparable with the state-of-the-art DAC demonstra-\ntion of about 1\u2009mg\u2009m\u22122\u2009s\u22121(ref.\u200938). Future improvements, including \nlower-cost catalysts, electrodes and ion-exchange membranes, are \nneeded to justify the scalability of our PSE reactor for DAC application \nwhen compared with decoupled electrochemical/chemical reactions, \nin which electrolysis could be operated under high current densities. \nOur mass-transport simulation model and further DAC experiments \non the impacts of pressure and catalyst-layer thickness lay the ground -\nwork for different tuning knobs to enhance the device performance in \nthe future (Supplementary Discussion\u00a01, Supplementary Table\u00a01 and \nSupplementary Figs.\u00a024 and 25).\nThe CO injection experiment shown in Fig.\u00a0 3f suggests the high \nresistance of our Co-SAC to CO poisoning resulting from the weak \ninteractions between the metal single-atomic sites and CO molecules32. \nNo notable changes were observed in the cell voltage and FEs (>90%) when CO or other toxic gas (such as NO and SO\n2) was injected into the \ninput gas stream (Supplementary Fig.\u00a026). The potential for practical \ncarbon-capture application was further demonstrated by the high \nstability of Co-SAC in our solid-electrolyte device (Fig.\u00a03g and Sup -\nplementary Figs.\u00a027 and 28), in which the cell voltage and FE remained \nunchanged during the 72-h continuous carbon-capture operation \nunder a fixed current density of 100\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122.\nTo make our study more practical, instead of using the above CO2\u2013O2  \nor CO2\u2013air mixtures, we prepared simulated flue gas (13.9%\u2009CO2, 7.8%\u2009O2, \n76.3%\u2009N2 and 2.0%\u2009H2O) as the gas input to our solid-electrolyte device. \nA tandem reactor system, with two identical solid-electrolyte cells but \noperated under two-stage current densities, was designed to deliver \nboth high carbon-removal efficiencies and high FEs (Fig.\u00a0 3h). To avoid \nthe depletion of O2 in flue gas owing to its relatively low concentration, \nwe recirculated the O2 stream generated through OER at the anode, \nwhich is the same amount of consumed O2 through ORR at the cathode, \nback to the flue gas stream. By holding the cell currents constant but \ngradually decreasing the flue gas input flow rate, the carbon-removal \nefficiency continued to increase.

This may result in \nsubstantially underestimated energy consumption, especially under \nindustrially relevant capture rates or low CO2 concentrations. The per -\nformance of our solid-electrolyte device can reflect more practical \nvalues of energy consumption for future carbon-capture implemen -\ntation, as it was evaluated in a full-cell device and included the entire \ncarbon-capture process (CO2 absorption and release) without making assumptions.

We would like to emphasize \nthat the PSE is an indispensable part of our carbon-capture device even \nwith an ultrathin middle layer (Supplementary Fig.\u00a032).\nSecond, the carbon-crossover efficiencies can be improved by means \nof the formation of different types of anion. As discussed above, we \nbelieve that the carbon crossover is through the carbonate ions, which \nrequire two-electron transfer per captured CO2 molecule (0.5\u2009CO2 per e\u2212).  \nOne possible alternative to improving the electron efficiency is estab -\nlishing the CO2\u2013H2O2 equilibrium42. Similar to the CO2\u2013OH\u2212 reaction in \nthe water system, CO2 can readily react with the HO2\u2212 anion from H2O2 \nto form percarbonate (HCO4\u2212)42. If we replace the 4e\u2212-ORR catalyst in \nour solid-electrolyte reactor with a 2e\u2212-ORR catalyst7, we may obtain a \nmaximal 50% increase in electron efficiencies. With every two-electron \ntransfer, one OH\u2212 and one HO2\u2212 could form, which can transport 1.5\u2009CO2 \ngas molecules across the AEM (0.75\u2009CO2 per e\u2212; Fig.\u00a0 4d). To validate this \nhypothesis, we used the Ni-SAC with a reasonable H2O2 selectivity in our \nsolid-electrolyte reactor for carbon-capture tests (Fig.\u00a0 4e and Supple -\nmentary Figs.\u00a033\u201336). As shown in Fig.\u00a0 4f, the carbon-capture rates on \nNi-SAC suggested a notable increase compared with 4e\u2212-ORR catalysts \ndemonstrated above. Under 100\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 current density, the 4e\u2212-ORR \ncatalyst presented a carbon-capture rate of around 0.7\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121\u2009cm\u22122, \nwhereas the Ni-SAC delivered a rate of 1.05\u2009ml\u2009min\u22121\u2009cm\u22122. The increased \ncarbon-capture rates were carefully confirmed by excluding the pos-\nsibility of O2 gas bubbles from H2O2 self-decomposition in the PSE \nlayer or any impacts of H2O2 on titrations (Supplementary Discus -\nsion\u00a02 and Supplementary Figs.\u00a037 and 38). By calculating the number \nof CO2 molecules captured per electron transferred, instead of using \nthe above-defined FEcarbonate  resulting from the multianion crossover \nmechanism involved, a promising 0.71\u2009CO2 per e\u2212 was achieved under \n100\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122, compared with 0.47\u2009CO2 per e\u2212 in the case of 4e\u2212-ORR \n(Fig.\u00a0 4f). Using other 2e\u2212-ORR catalysts, including oxidized carbon \nblack (OCB) and Fe-SAC (Supplementary Figs.\u00a039 and 40), we showed \nthat the carbon-capture electron efficiency linearly scales with H2O2 \nselectivity under the same current density, further demonstrating the \nimprovement of HO2\u2212 ions in transporting CO2 molecules (Fig.\u00a0 4g). We \ncan also exclude the possibility of bicarbonate crossover in the case of \nH2O2, which could also improve the electron efficiencies (Supplemen -\ntary Discussion\u00a03).\nThe improvements in cell voltages and electron efficiencies dis -\ncussed above can further reduce the carbon-capture cost of our device.  \nA techno-economic analysis based on previously reported models and \nthe performance of our device (Figs.\u00a02  and 3 ) suggests a base cost of \nabout $83 per ton of captured CO2 (refs.\u200943 ,44) (Fig.\u00a0 4h, Supplemen -\ntary Fig.\u00a041, Supplementary Discussion\u00a04 and Supplementary Table\u00a02).  \nBy taking into consideration the demonstrated improvements, \nincluding a thinner PSE layer (Fig.\u00a0 4b) and higher electron efficien -\ncies (Fig.\u00a04f ), the estimated cost can be reduced to about $58 per ton \nand can be more attractive if the value of generated H2O2 was included. \nConsidering this very initial study with each component to be further \nimproved and optimized in future research, our solid-electrolyte \ncarbon-capture reactor represents a competitive, promising and sus-\ntainable strategy for carbon management. For example, we can switch \nto other facile redox couples in different application scenarios, such \nas hydrogen evolution reaction/hydrogen oxidation reaction (HER/\nHOR) or organic and inorganic molecular redox couples, to further \nreduce the overpotentials. Further improvements of the ohmic drops \nof the reactor can be expected with a thinner middle layer and more \nconductive solid-electrolyte particles. Other operation parameters, \nsuch as temperature for better reaction kinetics and pressure for bet-\nter mass transport, could also be implemented for different appli -\ncation scenarios (Supplementary Figs.\u00a042 and 43). The mentioned \nimprovements could bring the carbon-capture cost down to about  \n$33 per ton.Conclusion\nGiven various electrochemical redox reactions available with proton\u2013\nelectron coupling processes (HER/HOR, quinone redox couples, flow \nbattery redox couples and so on), our solid-electrolyte reactor sets \nup a versatile carbon-capture platform that could be implemented \nin many practical scenarios in the future. It is worth noting that many \nelectrochemical redox couples, such as HER/HOR, present much better \nreaction kinetics and lower overpotentials than the OER/ORR cou -\nple we demonstrated in this work, which can substantially reduce the \ncell-operation voltage and improve the carbon-capture efficiencies. \nVarious cell and operation parameters, such as the thickness of the \nsolid-electrolyte layer, operation temperature and pressure, redox cou -\nple catalyst improvements and reaction pathway tuning, can be further \noptimized as future research directions to improve the carbon-capture \nenergy efficiencies and costs for practical deployments.\nOnline content\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summa -\nries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowl -\nedgements, peer review information; details of author contributions \nand competing interests; and statements of data and code availability \nare available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06060-1.\n1.

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone\u2013hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35\u00a0nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520\u00a0mV at a current density of 10\u00a0mA\u00a0cm\u22122, comparable to 530\u00a0mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90\u00a0mV dec\u22121, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2\u2212</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2\u2212</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications. To study the interface, thin films of a PPy/[Sn(dmit)3]2 were electrochemically grown with the aid of a microcell typically used in scanning tunneling microscopy assays. Raman and FTIR spectroscopies showed the effect of dimensionality on those materials, especially on the vibrational modes of dmit ring and on the 75\u00a0nm thick PPy/[Sn (dmit)3]2 film, which presents an optimized polymer chain conjunction length and a 20\u00a0% greater contribution to the polaron charge carriers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed the polaron/bipolaron ratio data, allowing us to determine other contributions to the surface charge density. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images show the hybrid thin film's different growth modes and the roughness evolution as a function of the electrochemical signal used in the synthesis.Acetylcholinesterase modified inkjet-printed graphene/gold nanoparticle/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) hybrid electrode for ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection2023, BioelectrochemistryShow abstractThis study successfully created a portable acetylcholinesterase sensor on a printed hybrid electrode capable of detecting chlorpyrifos in the field. While a screen-printed electrode was chosen herein to enable a single-use and portable platform for the in-field application, the hybrid material was incorporated to ensure ultrasensitive detection at lower electrode potentials. The hybrid ink of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated on graphene (GP) sheets in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was synthesized through a simple completely-green one-pot process. The subsequent characterization was carried out via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The synergy resulting from the greater surface area and enhanced transfer of electrons combined with high levels of electrocatalytic activity and superb conductivity offered by GP, AuNP, and PEDOT:PSS allows the sensor to exhibit ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection at the relatively low detection limit of 0.07\u00a0nM. The sensor demonstrated in this study also exhibits good reproducibility, desirable stability, and a successful application for the real sample with satisfactory recovery results of around 106\u00a0%, indicating its potential for use as a tool in the analysis of pesticides.Enzyme based bioelectrocatalysis over laccase immobilized poly-thiophene supported carbon fiber paper for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone2022, Molecular CatalysisShow abstractA modified electrode based on laccase immobilized poly-thiophene-3-carboxylic acid supported on carbon fiber paper was developed for the electrocatalytic oxidation of D-ribofuranose to otherwise difficult-to-access D-ribonolactone, a precursor for C-nucleoside based drug like Remdesivir. The electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuranose was achieved by the TEMPO-mediated electrochemical process. The experimental parameters were optimized and validated using Design of Experiment (DoE) statistical tool indicating the concentration of TEMPO and stirring as important parameters in bulk electrolysis. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuronose followed single electron anodic oxidation of TEMPO mediated by laccase to the corresponding oxoammonium nitrosonium species which was vital for the mediated electrochemical oxidation. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation was established using cyclic voltammetry and computational studies. The plausible interactions of laccase enzyme with TEMPO mediator were studied using molecular docking experiments. This facile method was successfully applied for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone.Electropolymerized melamine for simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine2020, Food ChemistryShow abstractPoly(melamine) (PMel) was synthesized via the electropolymerization of melamine monomer, which was then characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The possible polymerization mechanisms of melamine were also revealed by FT-IR spectroscopy and UV\u2013Vis spectroscopy. Next, the PMel modified GCE (PMel/GCE) was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite (NO2\u2212) and tartrazine, and the parameters were optimized. The kinetic study showed that the electrochemical oxidation of nitrite and tartrazine at the surface of PMel/GCE is a typical surface-controlled electrode process. Under the optimun conditions, the developed sensor outperformed those previously reported, and it also exhibited high selectivity and reproducibility. Finally, the PMel/GCE was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine in foodstuffs, and the results indicated that the proposed sensor could be a promising candidate for accurate determination of nitrite and tartrazine in real food samples.The role of electrolytically deposited palladium and platinum metal nanoparticles dispersed onto poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene) for enhanced glucose electrooxidation in biofuel cells2020, Electrochimica ActaShow abstractGlucose biofuel cells are one of the promising power supplies with a competent long-term stability and power density. In this respect, catalysts of palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) metal nanoparticles film coated electrode were fabricated for biofuel cell. The Pt and Pd particles were electrochemically deposited onto glassy carbon (GC) electrode modified with poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene), (p-1,8-DAN), via single or layer-by-layer electrodeposition. In results, Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC and Pd-Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC shell-core catalysts were fabricated and characterized by several analytical techniques such as AFM, EDX,SEM, TEM, and XPS, in addition to electrochemical methods. Their catalytic electrooxidation behaviors of glucose were investigated in alkaline medium. The as-prepared nano-catalysts showed improved electrocatalytic performances and better stability for glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) due to the presence of metal nanoparticles. The Pd as core and Pt as shell in Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC catalyst exhibited higher electrochemically accessible surface area (157.58 m2/g) and a favored electrooxidation efficiency. Moreover, the bimetallic Pt-Pd shell-core electrode showed higher resistance to poisoning (tolerance 1.24) and a decrease in the onset potential to -0.28\u00a0V. These multipurpose electro-catalysts are a potential candidate for developing a novel glucose biofuel cell.View all citing articles on ScopusResearch articleRecent advances in the synthesis of conducting polymers from the vapour phaseProgress in Materials Science, Volume 86, 2017, pp. 127-146Show abstractInherently conducting polymers (ICPs) combine the electrical properties of metals and semiconductors with a polymer\u2019s ability to flex and/or stretch. In general, polymers are relatively simple to synthesise, however, ICPs themselves have had limited uptake in consumer devices. This lack of uptake is in part related to the insolubility of many ICPs in common industrial solvents, and hence methods to manufacture them in a usable form have been problematic. Vapour phase polymerisation (VPP) is one method that provides a convenient route to producing thin films of both soluble and insoluble ICPs, and nanocomposites thereof. In this critical review the VPP process will be discussed from the fundamental viewpoint of the proposed polymerisation mechanism and the parameters affecting polymer growth for a range of different monomers (thiophene, 3-hexylthiophene, pyrrole, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, etc.). Looking forward into the future, new areas of polymer design and fabrication using VPP will be discussed, such as the enhancement of ICPs through additives, and next generation device fabrication based upon VPP ICPs.Research articleConducting polymeric nanocomposites: A review in solar fuel applicationsFuel, Volume 325, 2022, Article 124899Show abstractOver the last few decades, research is being carried out in the field of photocatalysis to investigate for fuels production in sustainable manner. Due to an energy depletion and CO2 emission in the current situation urge us to produce alternative fuels. Water splitting and the reduction of carbon dioxide using various photocatalysts are being developed as promising sustainable methods to obtain eco-friendly energy sources. Conducting polymers (CP) stand out among the current pool of studied photocatalysts due to their high light absorption efficiency, good stability, tunable electronic characteristics, and cost effectiveness. Various CP, such as polyaniline, polythiophene, and polypyrrole have been integrated with different semiconducting nanomaterials to produce photocatalytic composites. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the synthesis of CP and their nanocomposites for application in CO2 photoreduction and water splitting into fuel production using different polymeric composites. Many composite photocatalysts show synergistic effects between the polymeric material and other counterparts in the composite. The improvement in the inactivity of the composite can be attributed to the band configurations of the composite. Improving the separation of excitons, widening the light absorption region, enhancing the substrate adsorption, and preventing photocorrosion conductive polymers can significantly increase the photocatalytic activity under visible light. The addition of conducting polymers with an inorganic materials dramatically change their band positions and may reduce the possiblilty of electron hole recombination. Here, we explain by what means conductive polymeric material can improve the efficiency of the composite in an organized manner, thereby providing a comprehensive reference to the field. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of polymeric catalysts have been discussed briefly.Research articlePolyaniline/polyvinyl alcohol blends: Effect of sulfonic acid dopants on microstructural, optical, thermal and electrical propertiesSynthetic Metals, Volume 191, 2014, pp. 126-134Show abstractThis correspondence reports the preparation and performance of different polyaniline\u2013polyvinyl blends (PANI\u2013PVA) doped with sulfonated acids. PANI is prepared by in situ dispersion polymerisation, and a subsequent extensive study determines the effect of protonation upon doping with four different types of acids. We obtain the blends by changing the four different dopants, viz. \u03b2-naphtalenesulfonic acid (NSA), camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) and p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA), while maintaining constant PANI and PVA concentrations. The polymer thin films are deposited on glass substrates by the dip-cast procedure. Lastly, the films of the obtained blends are characterised by surface, structural morphology (elemental analysis, AFM, SEM, FTIR and XRD), thermal properties (TGA and DSC) and UV\u2013vis spectroscopy. The morphological analysis shows that the nanoparticles form different shapes, which depend on the type of dopant, whereas the FTIR spectra show the chemical interaction between the two polymers. The thermal study reveals three-step degradation of the polymer blends. To confirm the possible use of these blends in the electrical industry, the electrical properties are studied by in-plane I\u2013V characteristics and four probe conductivity measurements.Research articleIntrinsically conducting polymers in electrochemical energy technology: Trends and progressElectrochimica Acta, Volume 122, 2014, pp. 93-107Show abstractThe use of intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) like polythiophene (PTh), polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) in devices and systems for electrochemical energy storage and conversion is briefly reviewed with a focus on an overview distinguishing between already established uses and potential applications. Basic principles in these three major fields are highlighted:\u2022ICPs as active masses.\u2022ICPs as conductance-enhancing additives.\u2022ICPs as auxiliary materials beyond conductance.Research articleMultifunctional electrocatalysts derived from conducting polymer and metal organic framework complexesNano Energy, Volume 45, 2018, pp. 127-135Show abstractHigh cost, scarcity, and detrimental environmental effect of the noble-metal based catalysts have prompted the seek of less expensive, more benign, and earth abundant substitutes for energy conversion and storage. Here, we demonstrate a novel multifunctional electrocatalyst constructed by pyrolysis of the complex of polyaniline (PANI) and metal organic framework [Co-based MOF; zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67)]. The resultant PANI/ZIF-67 complex unveiled excellent electrocatalytic activities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. It was found that the catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 complex towards ORR, OER and HER could be tuned by simple changing the weight ratio of PANI to the MOF. Further, we tested the material as an air electrode for a primary zinc-air battery, demonstrating an open-circuit potential of 1.42\u00a0V and a peak power density of ~ 45\u00a0mW\u00a0cm\u22122 - both are superior to those of its counterpart of the Pt/C air-electrode. The excellent multifunctional catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 are mainly attributed to the synergistic combination of cobalt nanoparticles, Co3O4, and nitrogen doped carbon from the PANI/ZIF-67 complex after pyrolysis.Research articleProtective polymeric films for industrial substrates: A critical review on past and recent applications with conducting polymers and polymer composites/nanocompositesProgress in Materials Science, Volume 104, 2019, pp. 380-450Show abstractCorrosion defined as the deterioration of a material when it interacts with its environment is a global problem. Among the different strategies employed to combat corrosion, the use of coatings and corrosion inhibitors are the most popular. Coatings or corrosion inhibitors form a layer over the metallic substrate and protect it against corrosion. Polymers, both naturally occurring and synthetic have been tested for metal corrosion protection as replacement for the toxic inorganic and organic corrosion inhibitors. Interest in them stems from their availability, cost effectiveness, and eco-friendliness (especially for natural polymers) in addition to the inherent stability and multiple adsorption centers. However, it is found that most polymeric materials studied are moderate corrosion inhibitors. Several attempts such as copolymerization, addition of substances that exert synergistic effect, cross linking, blending, and most recently incorporation of inorganic substances in nano size into the polymer matrix have been made to improve the inhibition ability of polymers. In this review, the application of conducting polymers, polymer composites and nanocomposites for corrosion protection of different industrial metal substrates are explored based on reported experimental data and their mechanism of inhibition explained. Some identified drawbacks and future direction in this area have also been highlighted.View full textCopyright \u00a9 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.",
