In this roadmap, we review recent progress in fundamental understanding, catalyst development, and in engineering and scale-up. We discuss the outstanding challenges towards commercialization of electrochemical CO2R technology: energy efficiencies, selectivities, low current densities, and stability. We highlight the opportunities in establishing rigorous standards for benchmarking performance, advances in in operando characterization, the discovery of new materials towards high value products, the investigation of phenomena across multiple-length scales and the application of data science towards doing so. We hope that this collective perspective sparks new research activities that ultimately bring us a step closer towards establishing a low- or zero-emission carbon cycle.\nExport citation and abstract\nBibTeX\nRIS\nPrevious article in issue\nNext article in issue\nOriginal content from this work may be used under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license.

Electrochemically mediated carbon capture can be achieved by developing redox-active Lewis bases, with quinones being the most representative chemistry. In aprotic electrolytes, a subset of quinoid species can selectively uptake CO2 from a dilute feed upon electro-reduction via a nucleophilic addition reaction and release a concentrated CO2 product stream upon oxidation. However, there is a lack of quantitative understanding of the reaction kinetics landscape of redox-active CO2 sorbents, especially considering the complex nature of the multi-component electrolyte media they must be deployed in. To bridge this knowledge gap, we investigate the bimolecular reaction rate constant between CO2 and radical anions of various quinones in a range of electrolytes using an electroanalytical technique. Combined with molecular dynamics and density functional theory calculations, we provide insights into the complex interplay between quinone chemistry, supporting salt composition, and electrolyte solvents on the intrinsic CO2 adduct formation kinetics. To summarize some key observations, we found that the reaction rate is affected by both the identity and concentration of the cationic and anionic species in the supporting electrolyte, the presence of hydrogen-bonding additives may accelerate the kinetics, and ortho-isomers of quinones have a faster reaction rate than para-isomers. We believe the work can help guide the rational design of electrochemical microenvironments for enhanced electrochemically mediated carbon capture performance.KEYWORDS:carbon capture electrochemical separation quinones reaction kineticsSupporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssuschemeng.3c03321.Detailed experimental and computational methods, additional electrochemical data, additional MD and DFT results, and experimental results (PDF)sc3c03321_si_001.pdf (10.36 MB)\nTerms & Conditions\nMost electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.

However, a key challenge in these systems is how to favour production of multicarbon molecules, such as ethylene, which typically necessitates a strong alkaline environment. Here we use bifunctional ionomers as polymer electrolytes that are not only ionically conductive but can also activate CO2 at the catalyst\u2013electrolyte interface and favour ethylene synthesis, while running on pure water. Specifically, we use quaternary ammonia poly(ether ether ketone) (QAPEEK), which contains carbonyl groups in the polymer chain, as the bifunctional electrolyte. An electrolyser running on CO2 and pure water exhibits a total current density of 1,000\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 at cell voltages as low as 3.73\u2009V. At 3.54\u2009V, ethylene is produced with the industrial-scale partial current density of 420\u2009mA\u2009cm\u22122 without any electrolyte consumption.\nAccess through your institution\nBuy or subscribe\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\nAccess through your institution\nAccess through your institution\nChange institution\nBuy or subscribe\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journalsGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription$29.99 /\u00a030\u00a0dayscancel any timeLearn moreSubscribe to this journalReceive 12 digital issues and online access to articles$119.00 per yearonly $9.92 per issueLearn moreRent or buy this articlePrices vary by article typefrom$1.95to$39.95Learn morePrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nLog in\nLearn about institutional subscriptions\nRead our FAQs\nContact customer support\nFig. 1: MEA electrolyser with 0.1\u2009M KHCO3 anolyte.Fig. 2: MEA electrolyser operated with pure water.Fig. 3: Effects of ionomer coating on Cu surface towards the CO2RR.Fig. 4: Synergetic catalytic mechanism of QAPEEK.Fig. 5: MEA electrolysers with Cu-ionomer GDEs.Fig. 6: MEA electrolyser using porous Cu\u2013QAPEEK GDE.\nData availability\nAll data supporting the findings of this study are available within the paper and Supplementary Information files.\nReferencesOlah, G.

    "Main Findings:\n- The use of solid-state polymer electrolytes in CO2 electrolysers improved efficiency and enabled co-electrolysis of CO2 and pure water.\n- Bifunctional ionomers as polymer electrolytes facilitated both ion conduction and CO2 activation at the catalyst-electrolyte interface, favoring ethylene synthesis.\n- Quaternary ammonia poly(ether ether ketone) (QAPEEK) was identified as a suitable bifunctional electrolyte due to its carbonyl groups.\n\nChallenges:\n- The production of multicarbon molecules, like ethylene, is a key challenge in CO2 electrolysers due to the need for a strong alkaline environment.\n\nNoteworthy:\n- The ability to produce ethylene with low cell voltages and without electrolyte consumption indicates high efficiency and reduced operational costs in CO2 electrolysers."

Extensive lab-scale scientific studies have been performed on the conversion of various biomass feedstocks to energy in the form of electricity, heat and fuels/chemicals in solid, liquid and gases. The current review gives an overview of different thermal and biochemical technologies (incineration, gasification, pyrolysis, liquefaction, carbonization, cogeneration, anaerobic digestion, ethanol fermentation, transesterification, etc.) for bioenergy generation. The advantages and limitations of primary conversion technologies like thermochemical and biochemical conversion techniques have also been discussed here. Different type of biomass-based feedstocks, their pretreatment requirements, are reviewed. The health and environmental hazards of biomass energy conversion plants and their advantages over conventional fuel sources are discussed in detail. The review also discusses air pollution hazards related to different pollutants and diverse preventive measures taken to mitigate the problem. The current study also discusses the potential and limitations of biomass energy generation projects considering process economy, technological limitation, socio-political aspect and the role of government policies from the Indian context. The extended discussion on the aforementioned criteria further reaffirms the necessity of the current review.KeywordsBiomassBioenergyThermochemical-biochemical conversionBiogasEconomical aspectsIndia\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution.\nBuying options\nChapter\nUSD \u00a0 29.95\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\nAvailable as PDF\nRead on any device\nInstant download\nOwn it forever\nBuy Chapter\neBook\nUSD \u00a0 149.00\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\nAvailable as EPUB and PDF\nRead on any device\nInstant download\nOwn it forever\nBuy eBook\nSoftcover Book\nUSD \u00a0 199.99\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\nCompact, lightweight edition\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\nBuy Softcover Book\nHardcover Book\nUSD \u00a0 199.99\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\nDurable hardcover edition\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\nBuy Hardcover Book\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout\nPurchases are for personal use onlyLearn about institutional subscriptions\nAbbreviationsBOD:\nBiological oxygen demand\nCDM:\nClean Development Mechanism\nCPCB:\nCentral Pollution Control Board\nESP:\nElectrostatic precipitators\nGHG:\nGreenhouse gas\nIPP:\nIndependent power producer\nLCA:\nLife cycle analysis\nMSW:\nMunicipal solid waste\nMNRE:\nMinistry of New and Renewable Energy\nMW:\nMegawatt\nNNBOMP:\nNew National Biogas and Organic Manure Programme\nNGCC:\nNatural Gas Combined Cycle\nTWh:\nTerawatt hour\nReferencesAbbaszaadeh, A., et al.
