Electrochemical carbon-capture technologies, with renewable electricity as the 
energy input, are promising for carbon management but still suffer from low capture 
rates, oxygen sensitivity or system complexity1–6. Here we demonstrate a continuous 
electrochemical carbon-capture design by coupling oxygen/water (O2/H2O) redox 
couple with a modular solid-electrolyte reactor7. By performing oxygen reduction 
reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) redox electrolysis, our device can efficiently absorb dilute carbon dioxide (CO
2) molecules at the high-alkaline 
cathode–membrane interface to form carbonate ions, followed by a neutralization process through the proton flux from the anode to continuously output a high-purity 
(>99%) CO
2 stream from the middle solid-electrolyte layer. No chemical inputs were 
needed nor side products generated during the whole carbon absorption/release 
process. High carbon-capture rates (440 mA cm−2, 0.137 mmolCO2 min−1 cm−2 or 
86.7 kgCO2 day−1 m−2), high Faradaic efficiencies (>90% based on carbonate), high 
carbon-removal efficiency (>98%) in simulated flue gas and low energy consumption (starting from about 150 kJ per mol
CO2) were demonstrated in our carbon-capture 
solid-electrolyte reactor, suggesting promising practical applications.
CO2 capture from dilute sources, ranging from industrial waste gas 
to atmosphere, plays an increasingly important role in managing 
global CO2 emissions and promoting downstream CO2 storage and 
use1,3,8,9. Existing carbon-capture technologies (such as the amine 
scrubbing and Ca(OH)2/CaCO3/CaO+CO2 cycling process) typically 
rely on an energy-intensive and centralized thermal cycling process, 
in which elevated temperatures (as high as 900 °C in the case of CaCO3 
decomposition) are needed to release the absorbed CO2 (refs. 10 –12). 
Other carbon-capture methods that use solid sorbents with high 
porosity and surface area, such as metal–organic frameworks, have 
shown promising capture capacities but inferior cycling stability, 
especially when exposed to humidity13– 15. Although electrochemical 
carbon-capture methods have gained attention as appealing alterna -
tives owing to their high energy efficiency, decentralized operation, 
ambient reaction conditions and ability to use renewable electricity, 
substantial challenges must be addressed before they can be widely 
implemented3–5,16–18.
In general, electrochemical carbon capture relies on either 
redox-active carriers or pH swing to absorb and release CO2. The 
redox-active carriers, such as quinones, have high energy efficiency 
owing to their facile reaction kinetics involved in binding and releasing 
CO2 molecules under reduced and oxidized states19,20. However, their 
practical applications are still limited by low capture rates (typically 
<10 mA cm−2) and sensitivity to O2 gas present in most CO2 sources. On 
the other hand, pH-swing methods using salt or water electrolysis to separate alkaline and acidic solutions, for CO2 absorption followed by 
acidification to release CO2, have been reported to be insensitive to O2 
and can deliver larger currents (about 100 mA cm−2)2,18 ,21,22. However, 
the decoupling of the electrolysis process from the CO2 absorption 
process requires energy-intensive downstream gas–liquid contacting 
processes, especially under low CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, 
by-products such as H2 (from water splitting)23 or Cl2 (from NaCl elec-
trolysis)24,25 generated in different pH-swing designs add complexity 
and challenges to decentralized carbon capture.
Here we report a different carbon-capture design by coupling O2/
H2O electrolysis with our porous solid-electrolyte (PSE) reactor7 for a 
continuous and modular CO2 capture from a wide range of CO2 sources 
at industrially relevant capture rate, high energy efficiency, no O2 sen -
sitivity and easy scalability and adaptability. As shown in Fig. 1a, our 
solid-electrolyte reactor comprises an ORR (O2 + 2H2O + 4e− = 4OH−) 
cathode and an OER (2H2O = O2 + 4H+ + 4e−) anode, which are sepa -
rated by a compact, but porous, solid-electrolyte layer to allow effi -
cient ion conduction (Supplementary Fig. 1). By performing this OER/
ORR redox electrolysis, the system does not consume or produce any 
chemicals, as the generated O2 from the anode can be recycled back 
to the cathode for a stoichiometric balance. To avoid flooding, an 
anion-exchange membrane (AEM) and a cation-exchange membrane 
(CEM) are inserted between the electrodes and the PSE layer. When 
O2 molecules get reduced by an active ORR catalyst (such as commer-
cial Pt/C) on the cathode, large numbers of hydroxide ions (OH−) are https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06060-1

Articlegenerated at the catalyst–membrane interface, which react rapidly 
with the CO2 molecules in the stream to form carbonate or bicarbonate 
ions (Fig.  1b). These carbonate ions, driven by the electric field, then 
migrate across the AEM into the PSE layer. Meanwhile, water on the 
anode side is oxidized to generate the same amount of O2 that gets 
consumed and releases protons (H+) that travel across the CEM into 
the middle layer to compensate the charge. These crossover carbonate 
and proton ions are recombined to form CO2 gas again, which can be 
continuously pushed out and collected in its high-purity form through 
a recycling water flow through the PSE layer (Fig.  1c).
Our solid-electrolyte carbon-capture design presents several advan -
tages over reported electrochemical carbon-capture methods. First, 
unlike some redox-active carriers that can be poisoned by the coexist -
ing O2 gas6, our proposed system fully uses O2 through ORR to create 
a strong interfacial alkaline environment for effective CO2 capture26. 
Second, there are no specific chemical inputs (other than water) or 
consumption during the capture process, as the device performs ORR/
OER redox electrolysis. Third, the triple-phase boundary created at 
the cathode of our solid-electrolyte reactor allows for rapid diffu -
sion of CO2 in the gas phase towards the catalyst–membrane inter -
face26–28, enabling the reactor to operate under large current densities 
for fast CO2 capture while still maintaining high Faradaic efficiencies. 
This is different from the traditional pH-swing method, in which the 
liquid-phase mass diffusion limits the rates of CO2 adsorption (through 
gas–liquid contact). Fourth, the capture system can take advantage 
of past advancements in fuel cells and water-splitting catalysts for 
high energy efficiencies and easy scalability. Finally, our PSE device 
enables a continuous, simultaneous and integrated carbon-capture 
and release process, which differs from traditional absorption/desorp -
tion cycles and simplifies the carbon-capture system for many on-site 
applications (Fig.  1d).Concept verification
To validate the proposed CO2-capture mechanism, we used commercial 
Pt/C and IrO2 as the electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, respectively29. 
Different CO2:O2 ratios were used to establish a fundamental under -
standing of the intrinsic CO2-separation performance of the system 
(Methods and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). As shown in Fig. 2a, the 
ORR/OER I–V curves under different CO2 concentrations were similar, 
suggesting that the O2 concentration instead of the CO2 concentration 
determines the cell activity. The onset potential (under 0.5 mA cm−2) 
is around 0.8 V, including OER and ORR overpotentials (around 200–
300 mV each), ohmic drops and pH overpotentials during electrolysis3. 
Under high current density, at which O2 mass diffusion starts to affect 
ORR activity, the I –V curve (without iR compensations; Supplementary 
Fig. 4) of 4.6% CO2 showed slightly better cell voltage than that of 8.6% 
or 13.9% owing to its higher O2 partial pressure.
Under a constant ORR/OER electrolysis current, we can obtain the 
CO2-capture rate, which is equivalent to the CO2 crossover rate, by meas -
uring the CO2 flow rate out of the PSE layer using water-displacement 
and titration methods for both the gas-phase and dissolved CO2 
(Methods and Supplementary Figs. 5–7). This CO2 dissolution can be 
avoided in practical operations by continuously recycling the deion -
ized water stream. The CO2 bubble formation within the PSE layer 
was found to have little impact on the middle-layer pressure or the 
device operational stability (Supplementary Fig. 8). Furthermore, the 
recovered gas product was confirmed to be high-purity CO2 through 
gas chromatography analysis (up to 99.7% without considering water 
vapour; Supplementary Fig. 9), allowing for direct integration with 
downstream utilization or storage processes without the typical 
energy-intensive secondary purification processes. No CO2 reduc -
tion gas or liquid products were detected during this carbon-capture

concentration, the CO2-capture rate increased almost linearly with the 
ORR current density ranging from 10 to 500 mA cm−2. By estimating the 
slope of the CO2-capture (or crossover) rate as a function of the ORR 
current, we found that, for every two-electron transfer during which 
two OH− ions were generated, there was one CO2 molecule captured, 
suggesting that the CO2 crossover is mainly through the carbonate ion 
instead of bicarbonate because of the high local interfacial pH. This 
conclusion is supported by the well-matched CO2-capture rates with 
the theoretical guideline, which assumes 100% carbonate crossover 
and is consistent with observations reported in previous studies5,16,18,30. 
Therefore, here we defined the carbonate Faradaic efficiency (FEcarbon -
ate) to better evaluate the carbon-capture efficiencies under different 
reaction conditions (Methods). The FEcarbonate  was maintained over 90% 
across a wide range of cell currents under 13.9% CO2, suggesting a high 
utilization efficiency of generated OH− ions. However, at high current densities, FEcarbonate  showed a slight decrease owing to the competition 
between the rate of carbonate formation and OH− migration. There 
were sufficient CO2 molecules around the catalyst–membrane interface 
at low current densities to react rapidly with the generated OH− ions 
before they were transported across the membrane by means of car -
bonate ions form. For high ORR currents, a large number of OH− ions  
were generated, depleting the surrounding CO2 molecules at a fast rate. 
This limits the mass diffusion of CO2 and allows some OH− ions to move 
directly across the AEM without reacting with CO2 molecules, resulting 
in lowered FEs. Even with lower FEcarbonate , our solid-electrolyte reactor 
delivered an impressive carbon-capture rate of 3.34 ml min−1 cm−2 (or 
0.137 mmolCO2 min−1 cm−2) at 500 mA cm−2, which is equivalent to a rate 
of about 86.7 kg CO2 day−1 m−2. According to the reaction mechanism 
discussed above, we can anticipate that the maximal current density 
required to maintain high FEs would decrease with decreasing CO2 
concentrations in the input gas owing to limited mass diffusion. This 05 10 15 2000.020.040.060.082,950 ppm CO2

Articlewas confirmed by the 8.6% and 4.6% CO2 tests, in which the maxi -
mal operation current to maintain over 80% FEcarbonate  decreased to 
400 mA cm−2 and 200 mA cm−2, respectively (Fig.  2c,d). Please note that 
the choice of ion conduction in the solid electrolyte plays a critical role 
in determining the cell voltage, particularly under high current density  
(Supplementary Fig. 11).
In principle, because ORR catalysis and CO2 capture are independent 
processes, the O2 partial pressure should only affect the cell activity and 
not its carbon-capture rates or FEs3,4. As shown by the I–V curve com-
parison in Fig.  2e, the solid-electrolyte reactor with air + 13.9% CO2 pre -
sented similar ORR/OER electrolysis activities to that of O2 + 13.9% CO2 
at low currents, but required higher voltages at higher currents owing 
to its lower O2 partial pressure. However, this cell-voltage difference 
did not affect the current efficiencies or CO2-capture rates (Fig.  2f and 
Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13). To further test the carbon-capture 
capability and adaptability of our solid-electrolyte device, we lowered 
the feed CO2 levels to 6,200 and 2,950 ppm while evaluating the cell 
performance (Supplementary Fig. 14). At low CO2 concentrations, the 
main limitation to the carbon-capture rate is the mass transport of 
CO2 from the inlet flow to the catalyst–membrane interface, which is 
a common challenge for scaling up of all carbon-capture methods. As 
shown in Fig.  2g, the CO2-capture efficiency was maintained above 80% 
within the current range 1–10 mA cm−2 but rapidly decreased to around 
50–60% when reaching 20–30 mA cm−2. This FE decrease is because of 
the mass-transfer limit of CO2 gas under this low-concentration condi -
tion, which became more prominent when the input CO2 concentration 
was further reduced to 2,950 ppm (Fig.  2h). In this case, the FEcarbonate  
decreased to about 55% under 10 mA cm−2 current compared with 90% 
in the case of 6,200 ppm. The observed FE trends imply that the opera -
tional current of the carbon-capture cell can be adjusted to suit different 
application scenarios, depending on the input CO2 concentrations, 
while still maintaining high electron efficiencies.
In practical scenarios, CO impurities are widely present in industrial 
flue gas owing to incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, which 
could greatly affect the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst because 
of poisoning effects31,32. As shown in Fig.  2i, the cell voltage under a 
fixed current of 100 mA cm−2 showed an immediate increase when a CO 
stream was mixed with the cathode gas input and continuously rose by 
about 300 mV within 10 h operation, suggesting a fast degradation of 
Pt/C ORR activity. The impurity poisoning effects on the Pt catalyst, as 
well as Pt scarcity and high cost, could limit the practical application 
of our solid-electrolyte carbon-capture device.
The impacts of different ORR catalysts
One unique advantage of our carbon-capture device is the flexibility 
in using different ORR and OER catalysts. Replacing the expensive 
Pt/C noble-metal catalyst with earth-abundant ORR catalysts can sub -
stantially reduce the materials cost; alternative ORR catalysts with 
different material properties could help mitigate the CO poisoning 
effect observed on Pt/C. One promising candidate is the recently devel-
oped transition-metal single-atom catalyst (SAC), such as Fe or Co 
single-atomic sites coordinated in N-doped carbon33,34. These SACs 
presented similar ORR performance to commercial Pt/C with high 
resistance to CO poisoning owing to the weak interaction between CO 
and the transition-metal centre35. Here we used Co-SAC as a representa -
tive ORR catalyst to investigate these possible advantages compared 
with Pt/C. Our Co-SAC was synthesized on the basis of a hard-template 
method developed in our previous study, which guarantees high poros -
ity and uniform distribution of metal single-atomic sites on the carbon 
matrix36 (Methods). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and 
other characterization tools suggest an interconnected 3D porous 
structure of Co-SAC reversely templating from the SiO2 nanoparticle 
templates (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Figs. 15–18). X-ray absorption 
spectroscopy (XAS) confirmed the atomic dispersion of Co as shown in Fig. 3b,c, in which only the Co–N coordination (located at around 
1.4 Å) was observed in the spectrum and no Co–Co interactions (about 
2.15 Å)37.
We first evaluated the carbon-capture performance of our Co-SAC 
under a standard 13.9% CO2 concentration. The I –V curve showed a 
similar catalytic activity and FEcarbonate  compared with Pt/C catalyst 
(Fig. 3d and Supplementary Figs. 19–21), suggesting the feasibility of 
replacing Pt/C noble-metal catalyst with earth-abundant materials. 
Differences became evident when we tuned the CO2 concentration 
to 6,200 ppm, at which mass transport plays a more critical role in 
determining carbon-capture performance. As shown in Fig.  3e, the 
Co-SAC maintained a high FE of more than 80% until 20 mA cm−2, 
under which the Pt/C counterpart only achieved roughly 60% FE. 
The carbon-capture rate of Co-SAC was 0.12 ml min−1 cm−2 under 
20 mA cm−2, suggesting a more than 30% improvement compared with 
Pt/C (about 0.09 ml min−1 cm−2). The improvement ratio was further 
enhanced to around 50% under 30 mA cm−2. Our Co-SAC can deliver 
40 mA m−2 current density with 60% FE and a carbon-capture rate of 
0.18 ml min−1 cm−2 or 4.8 kgCO2 day−1 m−2, suggesting a highly efficient 
carbon capture considering this low-CO2-concentration source. Differ -
ent from Pt/C catalyst with the active sites densely packed on the surface 
of Pt nanoparticles, Co-SAC has uniformly dispersed active sites across 
the whole carbon matrix, which enables a more uniform generation of 
OH− ions for a more efficient CO2 capture, especially when the CO2 mass 
diffusion is limited (Supplementary Fig. 22). We further explored our 
Co-SAC and PSE device carbon-capture limit by testing its direct air 
capture (DAC) performance (400 ppm CO2; Methods). As expected, the 
ORR current density to maintain high FEcarbonate  was decreased because 
of the limited carbon mass diffusions under DAC conditions (Supple-
mentary Fig. 23). Our reactor delivered almost 100% FEcarbonate  under 
a 0.5 mA cm−2 ORR current. This represents a carbon-capture rate of 
1.14 mg m−2 s−1, comparable with the state-of-the-art DAC demonstra-
tion of about 1 mg m−2 s−1(ref. 38). Future improvements, including 
lower-cost catalysts, electrodes and ion-exchange membranes, are 
needed to justify the scalability of our PSE reactor for DAC application 
when compared with decoupled electrochemical/chemical reactions, 
in which electrolysis could be operated under high current densities. 
Our mass-transport simulation model and further DAC experiments 
on the impacts of pressure and catalyst-layer thickness lay the ground -
work for different tuning knobs to enhance the device performance in 
the future (Supplementary Discussion 1, Supplementary Table 1 and 
Supplementary Figs. 24 and 25).
The CO injection experiment shown in Fig.  3f suggests the high 
resistance of our Co-SAC to CO poisoning resulting from the weak 
interactions between the metal single-atomic sites and CO molecules32. 
No notable changes were observed in the cell voltage and FEs (>90%) when CO or other toxic gas (such as NO and SO
2) was injected into the 
input gas stream (Supplementary Fig. 26). The potential for practical 
carbon-capture application was further demonstrated by the high 
stability of Co-SAC in our solid-electrolyte device (Fig. 3g and Sup -
plementary Figs. 27 and 28), in which the cell voltage and FE remained 
unchanged during the 72-h continuous carbon-capture operation 
under a fixed current density of 100 mA cm−2.
To make our study more practical, instead of using the above CO2–O2  
or CO2–air mixtures, we prepared simulated flue gas (13.9% CO2, 7.8% O2, 
76.3% N2 and 2.0% H2O) as the gas input to our solid-electrolyte device. 
A tandem reactor system, with two identical solid-electrolyte cells but 
operated under two-stage current densities, was designed to deliver 
both high carbon-removal efficiencies and high FEs (Fig.  3h). To avoid 
the depletion of O2 in flue gas owing to its relatively low concentration, 
we recirculated the O2 stream generated through OER at the anode, 
which is the same amount of consumed O2 through ORR at the cathode, 
back to the flue gas stream. By holding the cell currents constant but 
gradually decreasing the flue gas input flow rate, the carbon-removal 
efficiency continued to increase. At an input flow rate of 5 ml min−1, Nature | Vol 618 | 29 June 2023 | 963the remaining CO2 concentration in the tail gas decreased to only 
3,000 ppm, representing a 98% carbon-removal efficiency while main -
taining an impressive overall FEcarbonate  of 75% (Fig.  3i and Supplementary 
Figs. 29 and 30).Approaches to improving capture efficiency

Articleperformance without considering ohmic drops in practical devices, 
ideal scenarios with certain assumptions (such as assuming full con -
version of alkaline solutions into bicarbonate during CO2 absorption) 
or without considering energy uses associated with steps other than 
electrochemistry (such as gas–alkaline contact)39–41. This may result in 
substantially underestimated energy consumption, especially under 
industrially relevant capture rates or low CO2 concentrations. The per -
formance of our solid-electrolyte device can reflect more practical 
values of energy consumption for future carbon-capture implemen -
tation, as it was evaluated in a full-cell device and included the entire 
carbon-capture process (CO2 absorption and release) without making assumptions. Our carbon-capture energy consumption starts from 
about 150 kJ per molCO2 (0.8 V onset voltage) and gradually increases 
with increased carbon-capture rates (Supplementary Fig. 31). We believe 
that there is still plenty of room to further improve the carbon-capture 
energy effectiveness (Fig.  4a) and several potential strategies are  
presented as examples for future improvements. First, the thickness of 
the solid-electrolyte layer has not yet been optimized for smaller ohmic 
drops and better cell voltages. By decreasing the electrolyte-layer thick -
ness from 2.5 mm to 1.5 mm, we were able to reduce cell impedance and 
conserve approximately 200 mV of cell voltage under 100 mA cm−2 
current while maintaining similar carbon-capture FEs (Fig.  4b,c ).

advanced machining tools or 3D printing technologies for better cell 
voltages and higher energy efficiencies. We would like to emphasize 
that the PSE is an indispensable part of our carbon-capture device even 
with an ultrathin middle layer (Supplementary Fig. 32).
Second, the carbon-crossover efficiencies can be improved by means 
of the formation of different types of anion. As discussed above, we 
believe that the carbon crossover is through the carbonate ions, which 
require two-electron transfer per captured CO2 molecule (0.5 CO2 per e−).  
One possible alternative to improving the electron efficiency is estab -
lishing the CO2–H2O2 equilibrium42. Similar to the CO2–OH− reaction in 
the water system, CO2 can readily react with the HO2− anion from H2O2 
to form percarbonate (HCO4−)42. If we replace the 4e−-ORR catalyst in 
our solid-electrolyte reactor with a 2e−-ORR catalyst7, we may obtain a 
maximal 50% increase in electron efficiencies. With every two-electron 
transfer, one OH− and one HO2− could form, which can transport 1.5 CO2 
gas molecules across the AEM (0.75 CO2 per e−; Fig.  4d). To validate this 
hypothesis, we used the Ni-SAC with a reasonable H2O2 selectivity in our 
solid-electrolyte reactor for carbon-capture tests (Fig.  4e and Supple -
mentary Figs. 33–36). As shown in Fig.  4f, the carbon-capture rates on 
Ni-SAC suggested a notable increase compared with 4e−-ORR catalysts 
demonstrated above. Under 100 mA cm−2 current density, the 4e−-ORR 
catalyst presented a carbon-capture rate of around 0.7 ml min−1 cm−2, 
whereas the Ni-SAC delivered a rate of 1.05 ml min−1 cm−2. The increased 
carbon-capture rates were carefully confirmed by excluding the pos-
sibility of O2 gas bubbles from H2O2 self-decomposition in the PSE 
layer or any impacts of H2O2 on titrations (Supplementary Discus -
sion 2 and Supplementary Figs. 37 and 38). By calculating the number 
of CO2 molecules captured per electron transferred, instead of using 
the above-defined FEcarbonate  resulting from the multianion crossover 
mechanism involved, a promising 0.71 CO2 per e− was achieved under 
100 mA cm−2, compared with 0.47 CO2 per e− in the case of 4e−-ORR 
(Fig.  4f). Using other 2e−-ORR catalysts, including oxidized carbon 
black (OCB) and Fe-SAC (Supplementary Figs. 39 and 40), we showed 
that the carbon-capture electron efficiency linearly scales with H2O2 
selectivity under the same current density, further demonstrating the 
improvement of HO2− ions in transporting CO2 molecules (Fig.  4g). We 
can also exclude the possibility of bicarbonate crossover in the case of 
H2O2, which could also improve the electron efficiencies (Supplemen -
tary Discussion 3).
The improvements in cell voltages and electron efficiencies dis -
cussed above can further reduce the carbon-capture cost of our device.  
A techno-economic analysis based on previously reported models and 
the performance of our device (Figs. 2  and 3 ) suggests a base cost of 
about $83 per ton of captured CO2 (refs. 43 ,44) (Fig.  4h, Supplemen -
tary Fig. 41, Supplementary Discussion 4 and Supplementary Table 2).  
By taking into consideration the demonstrated improvements, 
including a thinner PSE layer (Fig.  4b) and higher electron efficien -
cies (Fig. 4f ), the estimated cost can be reduced to about $58 per ton 
and can be more attractive if the value of generated H2O2 was included. 
Considering this very initial study with each component to be further 
improved and optimized in future research, our solid-electrolyte 
carbon-capture reactor represents a competitive, promising and sus-
tainable strategy for carbon management. For example, we can switch 
to other facile redox couples in different application scenarios, such 
as hydrogen evolution reaction/hydrogen oxidation reaction (HER/
HOR) or organic and inorganic molecular redox couples, to further 
reduce the overpotentials. Further improvements of the ohmic drops 
of the reactor can be expected with a thinner middle layer and more 
conductive solid-electrolyte particles. Other operation parameters, 
such as temperature for better reaction kinetics and pressure for bet-
ter mass transport, could also be implemented for different appli -
cation scenarios (Supplementary Figs. 42 and 43). The mentioned 
improvements could bring the carbon-capture cost down to about  
$33 per ton.Conclusion
Given various electrochemical redox reactions available with proton–
electron coupling processes (HER/HOR, quinone redox couples, flow 
battery redox couples and so on), our solid-electrolyte reactor sets 
up a versatile carbon-capture platform that could be implemented 
in many practical scenarios in the future. It is worth noting that many 
electrochemical redox couples, such as HER/HOR, present much better 
reaction kinetics and lower overpotentials than the OER/ORR cou -
ple we demonstrated in this work, which can substantially reduce the 
cell-operation voltage and improve the carbon-capture efficiencies. 
Various cell and operation parameters, such as the thickness of the 
solid-electrolyte layer, operation temperature and pressure, redox cou -
ple catalyst improvements and reaction pathway tuning, can be further 
optimized as future research directions to improve the carbon-capture 
energy efficiencies and costs for practical deployments.

Synthesis of SACs
The method used for synthesizing Co-SAC is based on our previ -
ously reported method, with some modifications36. First, 1.0 g of 
o-phenylenediamine, 0.44 g of CoCl2 and 2.0 g of SiO2 nanoparti -
cles (10–20 nm, Aldrich) templates were mixed together by using 
20 ml 1.0 M HCl solution. Then, the mixed solution was sonicated for 
0.5 h and stirred for another 0.5 h. Subsequently, 12 ml of 1.0 M HCl 
solution, which contains 3.0 g of ammonium peroxydisulfate, that 
is, (NH4)2S2O8, was added dropwise into the above mixed solution 
with vigorous stirring. After polymerization in an ice bath for nearly 
one day, the mixture was dried using a rotary evaporator. Then, the 
dried powder was annealed under Ar atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h. 
Finally, the product was treated by alkaline (2.0 M NaOH) and acid 
(2.0 M H2SO4) leaching successively to remove SiO2 nanoparticles 
templates and unstable Co-based species, respectively, to obtain 
the Co-SAC. We used the same method to prepare Ni-SAC. The only 
difference is that 0.405 g NiCl2·6H2O and 1.0 g SiO2 were used to syn-
thesize Ni-SAC. Fe-SAC was obtained on the basis of our previous  
paper.
Synthesis of OCB catalysts
OCB is synthesized on the basis of our previously reported method7,45. 
2 g of commercially available XC-72 carbon (Vulcan XC-72, Fuel Cell 
Store) was added into a three-neck flask with 460 ml 70% HNO3 solu -
tion and 140 ml deionized water. The mixture was well stirred and 
refluxed at 80 °C for 24 h. The resulting slurry was washed with water 
and ethanol after natural cooling until the solution pH reached neu -
tral, and the precipitate obtained was dried overnight at 80 °C in  
an oven.
Preparation of electrode
For preparation of cathode electrode, typically, 40 mg of as-prepared 
catalysts, 4 ml of 2-propanol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 160 µl of Nafion 
binder solution (Sigma, 5%) were mixed together to form a catalyst 
ink with around 10.0 mg ml−1. The ink was sonicated for about 30 min 
to obtain a homogeneous ink and then spray coated onto the 5 × 5 cm2 
Sigracet 28 BC gas-diffusion layer (GDL; Fuel Cell Store) electrodes. 
The Pt/C (Fuel Cell Store) used in this work followed the same proce -
dure to prepare the cathode electrode. The IrO2 electrode purchased 
from Dioxide Materials was used for the anode electrode during the 
electrochemical process.
Electrochemical CO2 capture
Electrochemical measurements were all conducted using a Bio -
Logic VMP3 workstation. The PSE reactor used respective catalysts 
Pt/C, Co-SAC, loaded on 1.0 cm2 GDL as the cathode electrode. This 
geometric area of the electrodes was fixed unless otherwise noted.  
A 0.015-inch-thick polytetrafluoroethylene gasket with 1.0 cm2 window 
and Sustainion AEM membrane was placed between the cathode elec -
trode and the solid-electrolyte layer. The middle-layer solid-electrolyte 
compartment comprises 2.5 mm Delrin plastic (1.5 mm for thinner 
middle-layer plate) and is packed with Dowex 50W X8 hydrogen-form 
solid electrolyte to ensure ionic conductivity. Nafion 117 film (Fuel Cell 
Store) with a second polytetrafluoroethylene gasket was placed on 
the anode and IrO2 (Dioxide Materials) was used as the anode for the 
OER. For the standard tests, the cathode was supplied with humidi -
fied CO2 (Airgas, 99.999%) and 200 standard cubic centimetres per 
minute (sccm) O2 (Airgas, 99.999%) or air (Airgas, zero grade) mix -
tures by precisely tuning the gas flow rates using digital mass flow 
controllers (Alicat), followed by a concentration calibration (13.9%, 
8.6% and 4.6% CO2) using a CO2 meter (CO2Meter) for all tests. For the 
poisoning-effect test, further toxic gas, including CO (Airgas, 99.999%), 
SO2 (Airgas, 1,800 ppm balanced with N2) or NO (Airgas, 5,000 ppm balanced with N2), was injected and diluted to the required concen -
tration with a fixed 13.9% CO2 concentration. To avoid insufficient 
CO2 supply impeding the evaluation of the intrinsic performance, 
the input gas mixture flow rate was adjusted to guarantee more than 
80% CO2 left over in the tail gas (less than 20% crossover). Therefore, 
for the 6,200 ppm and 2,950 ppm CO2 tests, the flow rate of inlet O2 was 
increased to 300 sccm to minimize the FE measurement error associ-
ated with CO2 stream flow rate change. For direct air-capture tests, we 
used 400 ppm CO2 (Airgas) as the input source and increased the total 
air gas flow to 1,000 sccm to ensure sufficient CO2. At the same time, we 
also used a 6-cm2 electrode to increase the total carbon-capture cur -
rent for minimized measurement errors in carbon-capture rates. For 
the flue gas capture, a simulated flue gas (13.9% CO2, 7.8% O2, 76.3% N2 
and 2.0% H2O) was prepared as the gas input to a tandem reactor sys-
tem. The O2 generated from the first reactor was further recycled to 
increase the O2 concentration during the capture process. All gas flow 
rates were precisely controlled by the mass flow controller (Alicat) and 
the concentration of the mixture was measured and recorded by a CO2 
meter (CO2Meter). The middle solid-electrolyte layer was continuously 
flowed with 1.1 ml min−1 (0.5 ml min−1 for DAC and low-current-density 
tests) of deionized water to bring out dissolved CO2 and CO2 gas, and 
the anode side was circulated with 2.0 ml min−1 of deionized water or 
0.1 M H2SO4 (>300 mA cm−2). For the long-term stability test, the anolyte 
was replaced with 2.0 ml min−1 of deionized water, while everything 
else was conducted with the same parameters.
All cell resistance was measured by potentiostatic electrochemical 
impedance spectroscopy and all the whole-cell voltage was reported without any iR compensation except for Supplementary Fig. 4.
Middle-layer gas and liquid analysis
Water-displacement measurement was used to measure the gaseous 
CO2 flow rate (Supplementary Fig. 7). CO2-saturated 0.01 M H2SO4 was 
used during the water-displacement measurement to measure the 
CO2 bubble flow rate. It was pre-saturated with CO2 to minimize the 
gas dissolution and the acid was used to further suppress the CO2 gas 
solubility during the bubble flow rate measuring process. This water 
displacement showed high measurement accuracy.
To avoid introducing any CO2 contamination from external sources 
into our PSE layer, the deionized water flow we used to push out the 
captured CO2 gas was pre-saturated with Ar but not CO2. As a result, 
a fraction of captured CO2 will be dissolved into our deionized water 
stream, which needs to be titrated (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). 
In practical carbon-capture applications, we can always recycle the 
deionized water flow so that captured CO2 will be continuously pushed 
out in its gas phase after the stream is saturated. The middle-layer output stream containing dissolved CO
2 was collected directly in 
200–500 µl of 1 M NaOH. By collecting it into the alkaline solution, 
the loss of dissolved CO2 to air was minimized and a full range of 
titration could be conducted. 4 ml of this collected liquid was then 
titrated using 0.1 M HCl and pH meter (Orion Star A111). The volume 
difference between two equivalence points on the titration curve 
determines how many moles of carbonate species exist inside the liq-
uid samples. The dissolved carbon dioxide concentration was then  
calculated as:
QVC
Vq =∆× ×24.4(lm ol )×11−1
in which Q1 is the CO2 flow rate equivalent to dissolved carbon concen -
tration, ΔV  is the volume of HCl between two equivalence points on the 
titration curve, C1 is the concentration of the HCl solution used, 24.4 
(l mol−1) is the molar volume of an ideal gas at 1 atmosphere of pressure 
and room temperature, V is the volume of the sample titrated (minus 
the added alkaline volume) and q  is the flow rate of the collected liquid 
output.ArticleThe partial current density for a given gas product was calculated as:
jQQ
nF =+
24.4(lmo l)×× (electro dearea )i i12
−1−1
in which Q1 and Q2 is the volumetric flow rate of liquid and gaseous CO2 
determined by titration and water-displacement methods, respectively, 
ni is the number of electrons involved, which is 2 for FEcarbonate , and F is 
the Faradaic constant.
Characterizations
Scanning electron microscopy images were obtained from an FEI 
Quanta 400 field-emission scanning electron microscope. TEM 
characterizations and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy ele -
mental mapping images for SACs were carried out using an FEI Titan 
Themis aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope at 
300 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data were collected on a 
PHI Quantera spectrometer, using monochromatic Al Kα radiation 
(1,486.6 eV) and a low-energy flood gun as a neutralizer. All X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy spectra were calibrated by shifting the 
detected carbon C 1s peak to 284.6 eV. N2 adsorption–desorption 
isotherms were recorded on a Quantachrome Autosorb-iQ3-MP 
instrument at 77 K using Barrett–Emmett–Teller calculations for the  
surface area.
XAS measurement and data analysis
XAS measurements were performed at the Soft X-ray Microcharacteri -
zation Beamline (SXRMB) of the Canadian Light Source. Metal foils and 
metal oxides were used as references. The acquired extended X-ray 
absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data were extracted and processed according to the standard procedures using the Athena module imple -
mented in the IFEFFIT software package.
