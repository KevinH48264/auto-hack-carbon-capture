Get e-AlertsAbstractConjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) are usually obtained as amorphous or semicrystalline powders. Their insolubility and nonprocessability are considered as key bottlenecks that impede CMP applications. In this study, light-emitting, nanofibrous films were fabricated by electrospinning CMP/poly(lactic acid) (PLA) mixtures. The resulting nanofibrous films show a high flexibility combined with high porosity and surface-area-to-volume ratios. The CMP-based nanofibrous films have been used as sensitive sensors in the detection of nitroaromatic and benzoquinone vapors as well as oxidizing metal ions. Moreover, 4-iodophenyl-substituted graphene sheets were used as templates for growing CMP/graphene sandwiches. The graphene-based CMP (G-CMP) sandwiches are characterized by high surface areas and aspect ratios. Furthermore, hierarchically porous two-dimensional carbon nanosheets were obtained by pyrolysis of these carbon-rich G-CMP hybrids. The resulting carbon nanomaterials show excellent supercapacitor behavior with a 48% increased capacitance if compared to porous carbons without the graphene template.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b03290.Detailed synthetic procedures and characterization data and additional experimental results for the CMPs, G-CMPs, nanofibrous films, and corresponding carbons and carbon nanosheets (PDF)cm5b03290_si_001.pdf (4.06 MB)
