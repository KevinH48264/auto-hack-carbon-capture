The tangential research paper's main findings are related to electrochemical and electrocatalytic reactions of carbon dioxide. These findings can be significant in solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in a carbon capture system. 

One possible way the tangential research paper's findings can be useful is by exploring electrochemical methods for carbon capture. Electrochemical reactions have the potential to capture and convert carbon dioxide into useful products, such as fuels or chemicals. By utilizing electrocatalysts, the efficiency of the carbon capture system can be improved.

Additionally, the research paper may provide insights into the design and optimization of quinone polymers. Quinone polymers are known for their ability to capture carbon dioxide, but they are sensitive to oxygen. The research paper may offer strategies for tuning the electron density of the quinone polymer to minimize reactions with oxygen, thus improving the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system.

However, the tangential research paper may also demonstrate some drawbacks in using its main findings to achieve the ultimate goal. For example, it may highlight challenges in scaling up electrochemical carbon capture systems or limitations in the stability and durability of electrocatalysts. These drawbacks need to be carefully considered and addressed to ensure the feasibility and practicality of implementing the research paper's findings in a more efficient carbon capture system.
