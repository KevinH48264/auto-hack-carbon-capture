The tangential research paper's main findings on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes can be useful in solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in a carbon capture system. The paper discusses the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers, which can enhance the kinetics of electrode processes. This means that by using conducting polymers as catalysts in a carbon capture system, the overall efficiency of the system can be improved.

Specifically, the paper mentions the use of conducting polymer electrodes modified with dispersed metals, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes. These modifications can further enhance the electrocatalytic properties of the conducting polymers, leading to even higher efficiency in capturing CO2.

However, the main drawback demonstrated by the tangential research paper is that it does not specifically address the issue of carbon capture. While it provides valuable insights into the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers, it does not directly demonstrate their effectiveness in capturing CO2. Therefore, further research and experimentation would be needed to determine the specific application of conducting polymers in a carbon capture system and to evaluate their efficiency in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured.
