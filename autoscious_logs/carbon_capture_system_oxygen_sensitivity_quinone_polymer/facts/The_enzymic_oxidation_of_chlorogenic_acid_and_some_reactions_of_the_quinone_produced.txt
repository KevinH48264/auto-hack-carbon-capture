The tangential research paper's main findings are focused on the enzymic oxidation of chlorogenic acid and the reactions of the quinone produced. While the paper does not directly address carbon capture systems, it provides insights into the behavior of quinones and their reactions with other compounds.

The main findings of the tangential research paper can be useful in solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in carbon capture systems. The paper demonstrates that the quinone formed in the oxidation of chlorogenic acid reacts with various compounds in a specific manner. This knowledge can be applied to design a carbon capture system that minimizes the negative effects of oxygen by carefully tuning the electron density of the quinone polymer. By understanding the reactions of quinones with other compounds, it may be possible to develop strategies to prevent or mitigate the oxidation of reduced quinones in the presence of oxygen.

However, there are some drawbacks to using the main findings of the tangential research paper to achieve the ultimate goal of a more efficient carbon capture system. Firstly, the paper does not directly address carbon capture systems, so there may be limitations in directly applying the findings to this specific context. Additionally, the paper focuses on the oxidation of chlorogenic acid and the behavior of quinones in that specific reaction. The applicability of these findings to other carbon capture processes and quinone polymers may need further investigation. Finally, the paper does not provide quantitative data on the efficiency of the reactions or the energy requirements, so it is difficult to assess the potential improvement in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured.
