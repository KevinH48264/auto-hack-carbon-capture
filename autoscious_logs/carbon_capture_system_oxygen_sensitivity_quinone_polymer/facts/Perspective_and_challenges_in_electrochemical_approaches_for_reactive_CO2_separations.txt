The tangential research paper's main findings are significant in the context of achieving the ultimate goal of proposing a more efficient carbon capture system. The paper demonstrates the development of a novel quinone polymer that exhibits high selectivity and capacity for CO2 capture. This finding is particularly useful as it addresses the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen.

The tangential research paper's main findings can be useful in solving the key problem by providing insights into the design and synthesis of quinone polymers with optimized electron density. By carefully tuning the electron density of the quinone polymer, it is possible to minimize reactions with oxygen in the feed stream, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system.

However, the tangential research paper also highlights some drawbacks in using the main findings to achieve the ultimate goal. One drawback is that the synthesis of the quinone polymer may require complex and expensive procedures, which could limit its scalability and practical implementation. Additionally, the paper does not provide information on the stability and long-term performance of the quinone polymer, which are crucial factors for the viability of a carbon capture system. Further research and development would be necessary to address these limitations and fully exploit the potential of the tangential research paper's main findings.
