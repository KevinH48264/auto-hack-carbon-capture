The tangential research paper's main findings are significant for solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in carbon capture systems. The paper demonstrates a novel approach using quinones and alcohol additives to achieve oxygen-stable electrochemical CO2 capture and concentration (eCCC). This is important because most existing eCCC systems are sensitive to oxygen, which reduces their overall efficiency. By anodically shifting the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier using alcohol additives, the researchers were able to confer oxygen stability to the system. They found that ethanol was the optimal additive, as it improved both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant of the quinone redox carrier.

These findings can be useful in solving the key problem by providing a new strategy for designing more efficient carbon capture systems. By incorporating quinones and ethanol additives, it may be possible to develop a carbon capture system that is more efficient than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured. The paper also highlights the general applicability of using hydrogen-bond donor additives to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.

However, the tangential research paper also demonstrates some drawbacks of using the main findings to achieve the ultimate goal. One drawback is that the paper does not provide detailed information on the scalability and cost-effectiveness of the proposed system. Additionally, the paper focuses on the electrochemical aspect of carbon capture and does not address other important considerations such as the capture efficiency, CO2 storage, and utilization of the captured CO2. These factors need to be taken into account when designing a carbon capture system that is more efficient than the SOTA.
