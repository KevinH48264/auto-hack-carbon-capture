The tangential research paper's main findings on the oxygen uptake by gallic acid can be useful in solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in the carbon capture system. The paper demonstrates the reactivity of gallic acid with oxygen, which can help in understanding the oxidation reactions that occur in the carbon capture system. This knowledge can be applied to develop strategies to minimize the oxidation of the reduced quinones in the carbon capture system, thereby improving its overall efficiency.

However, there are some drawbacks to using the main findings of the tangential research paper to achieve the ultimate goal of proposing a more efficient carbon capture system. Firstly, the research paper focuses on gallic acid, which may not be directly applicable to the carbon capture system. Secondly, the paper does not provide specific information on the electron density of the quinone polymer or how it can be tuned to avoid reactions with oxygen. Therefore, further research and experimentation would be needed to apply the findings of the tangential research paper to the carbon capture system.
