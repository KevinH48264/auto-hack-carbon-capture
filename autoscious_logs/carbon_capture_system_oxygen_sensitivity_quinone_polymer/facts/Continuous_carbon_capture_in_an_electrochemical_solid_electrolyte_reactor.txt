The tangential research paper presents a continuous electrochemical carbon capture system that couples oxygen/water redox reactions with a solid-electrolyte reactor. The system efficiently absorbs dilute CO2 molecules at the cathode-membrane interface, forms carbonate ions, and continuously outputs a high-purity CO2 stream. The main findings of the paper demonstrate high carbon-capture rates, high Faradaic efficiencies, high carbon-removal efficiency, and low energy consumption. The system does not require chemical inputs or generate side products during the carbon absorption/release process.

These findings are significant because they provide a promising approach to carbon capture that addresses the limitations of other methods, such as low capture rates, oxygen sensitivity, and energy-intensive processes. The continuous electrochemical carbon capture system demonstrated in the paper offers high efficiency, decentralized operation, and the ability to use renewable electricity.

The main drawback demonstrated in the tangential research paper is the sensitivity of the system to oxygen in the feed stream. The presence of oxygen can reduce the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system and requires careful tuning of the electron density of the quinone polymer to avoid reactions with oxygen. This sensitivity to oxygen limits the system's effectiveness in capturing CO2 in the presence of oxygen.

To achieve the ultimate goal of proposing a carbon capture system more efficient than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured, the tangential research paper's main findings can be useful. The continuous electrochemical carbon capture system demonstrated in the paper offers high carbon-capture rates, high Faradaic efficiencies, and low energy consumption. These findings can be used as a starting point for developing a more efficient carbon capture system by further optimizing the system's design, materials, and operating conditions. Additionally, the use of different redox couples and catalysts, as mentioned in the paper, can be explored to improve the system's efficiency and address the sensitivity to oxygen.
