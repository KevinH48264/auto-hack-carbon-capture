The tangential research paper's main findings are related to the use of mixed ceria-based metal oxides for the fabrication of electrochemical enzyme biosensors. These materials have unique catalytic, electrochemical, and oxygen storage properties, which make them suitable for operation in oxygen-free conditions. The paper demonstrates the successful use of these materials in the development of an oxidase enzyme biosensor for the detection of phenol and dopamine.

The significance of these findings for the ultimate goal of proposing a more efficient carbon capture system lies in the potential application of mixed ceria-based metal oxides in the design of a carbon capture system that is less sensitive to oxygen. The presence of oxygen in the feed stream can reduce the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system by causing oxidation of the reduced quinones. By using mixed ceria-based metal oxides, which have oxygen storage properties, it may be possible to mitigate the negative effects of oxygen and improve the efficiency of the carbon capture system.

However, there are some drawbacks that the tangential research paper demonstrates in using mixed ceria-based metal oxides for the ultimate goal. The paper focuses on the development of an enzyme biosensor and does not directly address the use of these materials in a carbon capture system. Therefore, further research and development would be needed to adapt the findings of the paper to the specific requirements of a carbon capture system. Additionally, the paper does not provide information on the energy requirements or energy efficiency of the biosensor, so it is unclear how the energy consumption of a carbon capture system using these materials would compare to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems.
