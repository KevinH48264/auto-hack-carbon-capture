Thoughts on the significance of the tangential research paper's main findings and how different parts might be useful to achieve the goal:

Unfortunately, the tangential research paper does not provide any information or findings that can be directly used to solve the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in a carbon capture system. This lack of information limits its usefulness in achieving the ultimate goal of proposing a more efficient carbon capture system.

How the tangential research paper's main findings can be useful in solving the key problem:

Since the tangential research paper does not provide any findings, it cannot be directly useful in solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in a carbon capture system.

Main drawbacks that the tangential research paper demonstrates of using the main findings to achieve the ultimate goal:

The main drawback of the tangential research paper is the lack of information or findings that can be applied to solve the key problem. This limitation hinders the ability to propose a carbon capture system that is more efficient in terms of energy per ton of CO2 captured.
