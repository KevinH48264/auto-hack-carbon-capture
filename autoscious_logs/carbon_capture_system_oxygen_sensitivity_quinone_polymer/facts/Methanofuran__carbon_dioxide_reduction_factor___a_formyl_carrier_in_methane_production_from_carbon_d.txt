The tangential research paper's main findings are not directly related to carbon capture systems or the efficiency of capturing CO2. Therefore, it is unlikely that the specific findings of this paper will be directly useful in solving the key problem of improving the efficiency of carbon capture systems.

However, it is important to note that the tangential research paper discusses the role of formylmethanofuran (a coenzyme involved in methanogenesis) in the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane. While this is not directly related to carbon capture, it does provide insights into the mechanisms of CO2 reduction and the use of coenzymes in such processes. These insights could potentially be applied to the design and optimization of carbon capture systems.

The main drawback of using the tangential research paper's findings to achieve the ultimate goal is that it does not provide specific information or techniques for improving the efficiency of carbon capture systems. The paper focuses on the role of formylmethanofuran in methanogenesis, which is a different process than carbon capture. Therefore, additional research and experimentation would be needed to determine how the findings of this paper could be applied to carbon capture systems.
