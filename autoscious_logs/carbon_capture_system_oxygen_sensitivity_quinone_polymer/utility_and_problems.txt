Useful information from the paper analyses to solve the key problem and improve the initial approach:

1. The use of quinones in carbon capture systems can be optimized by carefully tuning the electron density of the quinone polymer to avoid reactions with oxygen.

2. Electrochemical methods, such as pH-swing and electrocatalysis, have the potential to improve the efficiency of carbon capture systems.

3. The use of mixed ceria-based metal oxides can provide oxygen stability to electrochemical carbon capture systems.

4. Nanofibrous and graphene-templated conjugated microporous polymer materials can be used to create flexible and porous materials for carbon capture systems.

5. The reactivity of gallic acid with oxygen can provide insights into minimizing oxidation reactions in carbon capture systems.

Common drawbacks in the paper analyses:

1. Lack of direct addressing of the sensitivity to oxygen in carbon capture systems.

2. Limited information on scalability, cost-effectiveness, stability, and long-term performance of the proposed systems.

3. Focus on specific reactions or materials that may not directly apply to carbon capture systems.

4. Lack of quantitative data on energy requirements and efficiency improvements.

To propose a carbon capture system that is more efficient than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured, the following approach can be considered:

1. Utilize the electrochemical cell architecture from the initial approach, which maximizes the surface area exposed to gas and allows for ease of stacking in a parallel passage contactor bed.

2. Incorporate the use of quinones as redox carriers for CO2 capture, but optimize the electron density of the quinone polymer to minimize reactions with oxygen.

3. Explore the use of mixed ceria-based metal oxides as oxygen-stable materials in the electrochemical cell to improve the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system.

4. Investigate the potential of nanofibrous and graphene-templated conjugated microporous polymer materials for creating flexible and porous materials in the carbon capture system.

5. Consider the use of electrocatalysis and pH-swing methods to enhance the efficiency of CO2 capture and release processes.

6. Conduct thorough research and experimentation to address scalability, cost-effectiveness, stability, and long-term performance of the proposed system.

7. Quantitatively evaluate the energy requirements and efficiency improvements of the proposed system to ensure it surpasses the SOTA in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured.

By incorporating these approaches and addressing the common drawbacks identified in the paper analyses, it is possible to propose a carbon capture system that is more efficient than the SOTA in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured.
