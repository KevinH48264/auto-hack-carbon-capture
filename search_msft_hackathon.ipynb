      "Broader context\n",
      "There is a clear scientific consensus on the role of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the unusually wild fluctuations of global climate patterns over the last century, to which carbon dioxide is the largest contributor. This has generated a scientific tide in the study of carbon removal techniques over the last three decades, which has slowly gathered momentum, culminating in the 2015 Paris Agreement, which heavily emphasized the role of carbon removal by tackling emissions or via negative emissions technologies. While a path forward for carbon capture is being shaped by a mix of incumbent actors and newcomers, the great majority of the proposed processes rely on conventional concepts. Moreover, most of these processes have a large balance of plant which hinders their potential to flexibly adapt to the multi-scale nature of carbon capture. Herein, we demonstrate a new approach which presents a paradigm shift in adsorption type processes and carbon capture. The electro-swing basis of our process allows its linear scaling with desired capacity and lends it geometric flexibility. It also allows carbon capture from streams of any concentration, and its release into any carrier streams, including pure CO2, with a low balance of plant.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "With the alarming increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and its implications for global climate pattern developments,1,2 mitigation of climate change through curtailment of anthropogenic CO2 emissions has been one of the most urgent socioeconomic and scientific problems in the global arena over the last decade.3 To this end, a number of technologies have been developed for the large-scale capture of CO2 from combustion and other industrial processes to produce high-purity CO2 streams for storage or valorization.4 The most mature of these technologies are solvent scrubbing, mainly amine scrubbing,5 and oxyfuel combustion,6 which target high CO2 concentration streams (>10%). These approaches have a large footprint and, when retrofitted to a process, can require major modifications to the plant. Consequently, there has been a major effort to develop new materials and processes for high efficiency CO2-capture, including sorbents for pressure and temperature swing adsorption systems,7 and membranes for selective transport of the CO2.8 Furthermore, many potential applications of carbon capture require compact devices due to space limitations, such as in the direct capture of CO2 from tailpipe exhausts on board mobile sources, in which there is growing interest given the large contribution of transportation exhaust to greenhouse gas emissions (33.5% of U.S. CO2 emissions in 2016).9\n",
      "In addition to the capture of CO2 from direct combustion processes, there is a need to remove CO2 from enclosed spaces for ventilation purposes in buildings and car cabins, or for cabin environmental control systems on board spacecraft and submarines, where the maximum allowed CO2 concentration in habitable spaces is 5000 ppm (or 0.5%).10 The first of such systems was developed by Winnick et al., for the electrochemical capture of CO2 in spacecraft cabins using molten carbonates.11 However, the low concentration of CO2 in such applications poses a challenge, mainly due to the low driving forces for mass transfer and the large quantities of other species present in air in addition to CO2.12 Thus, carbon capture is a multi-scale problem, where the CO2-rich streams to be treated vary greatly in volume, concentration and composition, and different criteria need to be fulfilled to ensure optimal processing depending on whether sources are industrial or small-scale (e.g., power plants or oil and gas heaters), concentrated or dilute (exhausts from combustion or air in confined spaces), and clean or contaminated with other pollutants.\n",
      "Many of the CO2-capture chemical processes that involve a capture agent such as amines or solid sorbents require temperature and/or pressure swings to release the captured CO2 and regenerate the agents for further capture. These swings result in inefficiencies due to energy wasted in heating solvents and sorbents, pressurizing feed gas, or drawing a vacuum for desorption. Electrochemical systems can minimize such parasitic energy losses as they can be operated at near isothermal conditions, with significantly higher efficiencies than their thermal-swing (TSA) and pressure-swing (PSA) adsorption counterparts.13 One mode of electrochemical capture of CO2 is through the use of a redox-active carrier.\n",
      "Electrochemically mediated selective transport of chemical species was first reported by Ward et al.,14 where a redox-active carrier (ferrous ion) was used to transport nitric oxide across a membrane. Since then, a number of systems have been developed for transporting chemical species by redox-active carriers that are activated at one electrode, to bind with the target species, and deactivated at the opposite electrode, to release the target and regenerate the carrier.15,16 Systems that have been proposed for the concentration of CO2 through this approach have been based on a number of different carrier molecules, such as quinones,17â€“20 4,4â€²-bipyridine,21 and thiolates.22,23 Quinones are of particular interest to this work for their superior electrochemical performance, serving as redox-active carriers for CO2 in electrochemically mediated separation processes. DuBois et al. demonstrated this possibility, and studied the thermodynamics of an electrochemical CO2 pumping system that utilizes quinones.18 More work followed, where Scovazzo et al. demonstrated the electrochemical separation of CO2 from <1% concentration gas mixtures using 2,6-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone as a carrier in ionic liquid (IL) and organic solvent electrolytes media,19 while Gurkan et al. screened a number of ILs to serve as suitable electrolytes for quinone carriers in an electrochemically mediated selective transport system for CO2.20 All of these systems, however, require the transport of the electrolyte and the dissolved carrier molecules between two electrodes in an electrochemical cell for capture and release of CO2. This limits their implementation in a number of applications where the requirement for flow systems and pumping, and the large footprint, are problematic.\n",
      "In this work, we develop a compact electrochemical device for CO2 capture that eliminates the requirement for complex flow systems, and that can be effective in the treatment of both high and low concentration feed streams. A quinone-utilizing faradaic electrochemical cell that fulfils these requirements and operates as an Electro-Swing Adsorption (ESA) process is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. The cell is comprised of two cathode electrode substrates coated with a CO2-binding quinoneâ€“carbon nanotube (Qâ€“CNT) composite sandwiching an anode electrode substrate coated with a ferroceneâ€“CNT (Fcâ€“CNT) composite, with separator membranes between the electrodes. This cell architecture is employed to maximize the CO2-binding surface area of the cell exposed to gas flow in a parallel passage adsorbent contactor design where stacks of these cells form parallel gas channels. The Fcâ€“CNT electrode serves as an electron source and sink for the reduction and oxidation, respectively, of the Qâ€“CNT electrodes to regulate the uptake and release of the CO2. Wetting of porous non-woven carbon fiber mats used as the electrode substrates by a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) electrolyte enables effective ionic currents to pass through the electrolyte on activation and deactivation of the electrodes, and permits the diffusion of CO2 into the electrolyte-wetted cathodes during capture.\n",
      "Fig. 1\n",
      "Schematic of a single electro-swing adsorption electrochemical cell with porous electrodes and electrolyte separators. The outer electrodes, coated with poly-1,4-anthraquinone composite, can capture CO2 on application of a reducing potential via carboxylation of quinone, and release the CO2 on reversal of the polarity. The inner polyvinylferrocene-containing electrode serves as an electron source and sink for the quinone reduction and oxidation, respectively.\n",
      "The effectiveness of the electro-swing concept for CO2 capture and release was demonstrated in a sealed system in which cell polarity was cycled to regulate the activation and deactivation of the carrier, i.e. reduction and oxidation of the redox active quinone. This was in lieu of the advection of the carrier electrolyte solution between two electrodes with a difference in potential.19 The performance of flow-through modules constructed with stacks of the assembled electrode cells was also assessed. The CO2 capture processes were modelled to provide greater insight into the operational principles for this technology.\n",
      "Ultimately, the goal of this work was to demonstrate an electrochemically activated packed parallel passage contactor adsorption system for the removal of CO2 from flue gas and other CO2-rich streams. The regeneration of the bed takes place on reversal of the polarity of the stack in an ESA, with analogies to PSA systems, where adsorption takes place at high pressure and desorption at a lower pressure,24 or TSA systems, where adsorption takes place at low temperatures and the fixed bed is regenerated at higher temperatures.25\n",
      "Results and discussion\n",
      "Design of the electrochemical cell\n",
      "Thin films of crystallized organic compounds have been studied as a means of immobilizing CO2 redox-active carriers onto electrode substrates.26 Redox-active polymers have long been the preferred electrode material when using organic molecules in electrochemical cells, however, because polymers are less soluble in the electrolyte than their corresponding redox-active repeating units, and thus the self-discharge of the cell can be avoided, and its cycling performance improved.27 For example, quinone polymers have been investigated as suitable cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries,28 and pseudocapacitive energy storage devices.29 These polymers are usually made into composites with conductive high-surface area carbon materials, such as carbon black, graphite or carbon nanotubes (CNT), to enhance the overall conductivity of the electrode material and increase the area of the polymer exposed to the electrolyte.30 Here, we used a polyanthraquinoneâ€“CNT (PAQâ€“CNT) composite for the cathode and polyvinylferroceneâ€“CNT (PVFcâ€“CNT) composite for the anode.31 The electrolyte used was the RTIL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bmim][TF2N]), selected for its low volatility, which allows for flow of gas over the wetted electrodes without loss of electrolyte to evaporation or entrainment.\n",
      "A sealed chamber was constructed in which CO2 capture and release on electrochemical activation and deactivation of the quinones, respectively, was indicated by the concomitant pressure changes in the chamber. A flow cell was also fabricated to house stacks of the electrochemical cells to allow for capture of CO2 from flowing gas streams of compositions similar to those of flue gases, air in aircraft cabins and buildings, and in the ambient environment. The adsorption effectiveness was assessed through analysis of the breakthrough profiles.\n",
      "The chemical specificity of quinones can provide near 100% purity of released CO2, which, when combined with a well-designed process in which 100% CO2 recovery is achieved, puts the technology much closer to the upper-right corner on the recovery-purity Pareto plot than those based on current CO2 sorbents.32,33\n",
      "Polyanthraquinone electrodes.\n",
      "Poly(1,4-anthraquinone) (P14AQ), shown in Fig. 1, was synthesized and incorporated into an ink with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Non-woven carbon fiber mat electrode substrates of thickness 150 Î¼m (35 g mâˆ’2) were dip-coated in the ink and dried very slowly to obtain a composite that uniformly coated the substrate at âˆ¼1.2 mg cmâˆ’2, shown in Fig. 2(a). The composite structure allows for a greater utilization of the anthraquinone repeating units in the polymers, and thus larger currents under applied potentials. The CNT mesh, shown in Fig. 2(f), provides a backbone to improve the conductivity of the conjugated PAQ via Ï€â€“Ï€ interactions with the anthraquinone units (Fig. S3, ESIâ€ ); it also provides a porous matrix decorated by the polymer chains for better electrolyte penetration. This results in a larger surface area of the polymer being exposed to electrolyte, and an increased conductivity in the composite.34 The Ï€â€“Ï€ interaction of the polymer chains and CNTs, and the subsequent decoration of the nanotubes with the polymer chains, shown in Fig. 2(e), also improved the suspension of the CNTs in the polymer solution, which resulted in very well dispersed inks. The ratio of PAQ to CNT was optimized, with the highest current per mass of active material (polymer) obtained at a 1:3, PAQ:CNT ratio by weight (Fig. S4, ESIâ€ ). The cyclic voltammograms in Fig. 3 shown in green (under N2) and red (under CO2) indicate the strong redox activity of these electrode surfaces; the differences in the current response following potential scans are discussed later.\n",

This was prepared by dispersing MWCNTs in a solution of PVFc in NMP. The optimum ratio of the composite was found to be 1:1, PVFc:CNT, by weight. The electrode substrate was dip-coated in the ink and dried slowly to yield a composite that uniformly coated the substrate at âˆ¼1.4 mg cmâˆ’2, as shown in Fig. 4.

      "The electrochemical cell.\n",
      "The PAQâ€“CNT electrodes were assembled into an electrochemical cell in which CO2 was able to be captured and released upon potential swings. This was accomplished by layering a PVFcâ€“CNT counter electrode between the two PAQâ€“CNT electrodes to balance the charge of these electrodes, as shown in Fig. 5(d). In a CO2-rich environment, this afforded a polymer-based battery with an electrochemical window of âˆ¼1.2 V, where all the charge from the ferrocene oxidation, at its reduction potential, was balanced by the charge transferred to the two-electron reduction of quinone, at its first reduction potential. This window is defined by the reduction potential of PVFcâ€“CNT and the first reduction potential of PAQâ€“CNT, shown in Fig. 3 as Î”V1. However, in the absence of CO2 or other such electrophiles, mainly under N2, PAQ retains its two one-electron reductions, with half of the charge of the ferrocene oxidation being balanced by the reduction of quinone at the first potential and the other half by its reduction at the second potential. This results in a wider electrochemical window, shown in Fig. 3 as Î”V2, and the behavior of the cell resembles that of an asymmetric pseudocapacitor.35\n",

      "The capacities of the anode and cathodes of the cell, evaluated by gravimetric charge calibration of the two electrode composite materials (Fig. S5, ESIâ€ ), were balanced by requiring that mP14AQâ€“CNT = 1.12mPFVcâ€“CNT, which allowed for some excess PVFcâ€“CNT.\n",
      "Carbon capture\n",
      "Two different types of units were fabricated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the electro-swing process. The first was a sealed chamber into which the electrodes were inserted. Changes in pressure were measured as CO2 was adsorbed and then released on cycling of the potential applied to the electrodes. The second approach used a flow adsorption in which the CO2 exiting the device was monitored, with the breakthrough point reflecting the overall capacity of the electrodes. All carbon capture experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "CO2 capture and release in a batch system.\n",
      "An electrochemical cell (4 cm2 of total exposed area) with the three layers, such as that illustrated in Fig. 1, was tested for the capture and release of CO2 in a sealed chamber, shown in Fig. 5. This cell had âˆ¼4.8 mg of PAQâ€“CNT deposited, i.e. 5.8 Î¼mol of quinone, or a capacity for 11.6 Î¼mol of CO2. From the monitored pressure changes in the chamber of known internal void volume, the number of moles of CO2 captured and released upon charge and discharge of the cell at constant potentials, were calculated. The chamber was purged with CO2 at the desired concentrations and sealed at atmospheric pressure. The pressure inside was allowed to equilibrate at constant temperature before the electrochemical experiments were started.\n",
      "The performance of the electrochemical cell was evaluated in chronoamperometric (potentiostatic) experiments, with capture at 1.3 V and release at 0.5 V, i.e. Î”V = 0.8 V. Fig. 6(a) shows the change in the number of moles of CO2 captured from pure gas over 10 cycles (blue), along with the charge transferred to and from the cell (red). It shows that âˆ¼65% of the quinone units were utilized, i.e. 7.4 Î¼mol of CO2 captured. This may be due to incomplete charging of the quinones that are not exposed to electrolyte. From the charge transferred during charging and discharge (âˆ¼800 mC), and the moles of CO2 captured and released, a faradaic efficiencyÂ (1)of up to 90% was estimated, with some of the charge lost to double layer charging of the porous electrodes. Here, F is Faraday's constant, Q is the charge transferred, and n is the number of moles of useful electrons transferred in the reaction, i.e. used for the capture of CO2, which in this reaction, is equivalent to the number of moles of CO2. This efficiency results in âˆ¼86 kJ per mole of CO2 captured and released, as determined by the relationÂ (2)where Î”V is the difference between the applied charge and discharge potentials.\n",

These experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "Fig. 6(b) shows similar results for the capture of CO2 from gases of different concentrations ranging between 15 and 100%. Again, quinone utilization was high, but dependent on the initial gas concentration, owing not to capacity limitations, but to a reduction on sorption dynamics due to mass transfer limitations with lower concentration driving forces. The electrochemical cell showed great stability with <30% loss in capacity over 7000 cycles of capture and release, Fig. 6(c). The gradual loss in capacity is mainly due to the electromigration of the shorter polymer chains, Fig. S1 (ESIâ€ ), from the electrode and into the electrolyte, towards the opposite electrode.\n",
      "In a different set of experiments where a larger cell (âˆ¼450 cm2 of total exposed area) was used, CO2 transport limitations became more prominent due to the larger internal volume of the cavity used. In this set, the effect of applying an overpotential was studied, where capture potentials of greater than Î”V1 (in Fig. 3) were applied during a 1000 s capture experiment. Fig. 6(d) shows that upon increasing the applied capture potential more CO2 is captured for the duration of the experiment, which indicates the activation of more quinone units on the electrodes during the charging half-cycle. Charging the system at âˆ’1.8 V for varying durations, Fig. 6(e), shows that the system is fully charged after 2000 s, but more CO2 is captured, i.e. more of the quinones are utilized, at increasing durations of capture. This demonstrates the transport limitations of the electrodes, as explained in later sections.\n",
      "CO2 capture and release in flow systems.\n",
      "The adsorption bed assembled consisted of a few electrochemical cells stacked in the flow device to allow the flow of gas in between, as illustrated in Fig. 7(a). The blue regions indicate the presence of CO2, and the decrease in blue intensity within the channel indicates the adsorption front, ahead of which the bed is still empty, and behind which the bed, i.e. the electrode assembly, is saturated with CO2 and cannot adsorb more. A number of different cells were constructed in the flow bed configuration shown in Fig. 7(b). The exposed area of a typical cell was 18 cm Ã— 10 cm, with âˆ¼0.2 g of P14AQâ€“CNT composite; at âˆ¼70% useful quinones, this amounted to the adsorption of âˆ¼9â€“14 cm3 of CO2. The channels between the cells were typically âˆ¼500 Î¼m thick, and bed volumes were about 35 cm3 with a total bed weight of âˆ¼1.5 g bringing the productivity of the bed to 0.01â€“0.02 kg CO2 per kgbedtb, where tb is the breakthrough time, i.e. the time to reach saturation of the electrodes or for the outlet CO2 concentration to begin to increase. At feed flow rates of âˆ¼10 mL minâˆ’1 and 15% CO2, this productivity is on par with the TSA systems reported by Ntiamoah et al.36\n",

      "(a) Schematic illustration of the parallel passage electrochemical cell contactor. The blue region indicates the saturated zone and the development of the mass transfer zone. (b) Photograph of a flow bed with a stack of the electrochemical cells.\n",
      "It can be shown that axial flow dispersion within individual channels was minimal at most flow rates, and that the transport resistances resided primarily within the electrodes. Imperfect packing of the cells in the flow device by hand did, in some cases, lead to significant channeling and large-scale device axial dispersion, however, with broad breakthrough curves, but it is anticipated that under optimal manufacturing conditions these effects can be reduced significantly.\n",
      "The chronoamperometric experiments performed in the sealed system were repeated in a flow system. Mixtures of N2 and CO2 at different compositions were flown past the stack of assembled electrochemical cells. Upon reduction of the PAQâ€“CNT electrodes, CO2 was removed (captured) from the inlet stream, and the decrease in the concentration of CO2 was detected at the outlet stream. In these experiments the bed was fully activated by charging at a constant potential greater than Î”V22 to guarantee the complete reduction of the all accessible quinone units prior to adsorption. Experiments with an initial half activation, i.e., at Î”V1, followed by adsorption at constant potential, did not result in different breakthrough curves, mainly because the kinetics of the reduction and the adsorption reactions are much faster than the rates of mass transfer of CO2 into the film, as discussed later.\n",
      "The breakthrough profiles obtained for one flow system are shown in Fig. 8(a). Breakthrough was achieved at smaller bed volumes of gas treated for higher feed CO2 concentrations, where the bed volume is a time measure which represents the total volume of gas treated at any given time relative to the volume of the bed itself. The breakthrough curves superimpose when normalized by the inlet CO2 concentration, shown in Fig. 8(b), which indicates a consistent behavior of the bed, i.e. equal utilization of the overall adsorption capacity regardless of the inlet concentration, an indication of a rectangular equilibrium isotherm. Note in this particular module that, although the breakthrough curves themselves were sharp, prior to breakthrough there was a consistent effluent concentration of 20% of the feed concentration, the result of a bypassing of the active cells by 20% of the total gas flow. The overall capacity of the bed can be calculated from the area between the line at Cout/Cin = 1 and the normalized breakthrough curve. A contactor bed of a desired overall capacity can be designed by linear scaling from this overall capacity. With a larger bed, CO2 was fully captured from a stream at 10% inlet concentration, which is on the higher end for carbon capture applications as it mimics combustion exhaust. Up to 10 bed volumes of feed were treated before breakthrough was achieved, indicating capacity of greater than one bed volume of pure CO2. It has similarly been shown that complete removal of CO2 with a smaller stack of cells (a scaled down contactor), five replicate capture experiments were conducted on an inlet stream of âˆ¼0.8% CO2, Fig. 8(d), which mimics conditions for ventilation of confined living spaces, such as space modules, submarines and buildings. The breakthrough curves were unaffected by the prior history of the bed, indicating that complete regeneration and restoration of the bed capacity was attained during the desorption following each adsorption run.\n",

      "(a) Breakthrough profiles obtained at four inlet concentrations. (b) Same breakthrough profiles in (a) normalized by the inlet concentrations. (c) Breakthrough profile obtained from a large system operating at âˆ¼10% inlet concentration. (d) Breakthrough profiles obtained from five replicate runs of a smaller system operating at âˆ¼0.8% inlet concentration. These experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "The broadness of the breakthrough profiles in Fig. 8(c) and (d) can be attributed to the variation in channel width. Since the electrochemical cell stacks are hand-assembled and fitted into the bed, some variation in channel width along the same channel and the parallel channels can cause an uneven distribution of flow resulting in overlapping of multiple breakthrough profiles, which culminate in a broad overall profile. Also, mass-transfer dispersion plays a significant role in the broadness of the profiles. As is evident from the long durations for an effective capture in Fig. 6(e), and discussed later, mass transfer of CO2 into the electrodes is the rate controlling step, and this causes axial dispersion that widens the mass transfer zone in the channel, illustrated in Fig. 7(a), resulting in broad breakthrough profiles in this case.\n",
      "Mechanism of CO2 capture\n",
      "Mizen and Wrighton first demonstrated the reductive addition of CO2 to 9,10-phenanthrenequinone in aprotic electrolytes. Quinones undergo two reversible one-electron reductions in aprotic electrolytes, at two reduction potentials, as shown in Scheme 1(a) for anthraquinone. But in the presence of CO2, a single two-electron quasi-reversible reduction takes place at the first reduction potential, as shown in Scheme 1(b), where the CO2 molecule carboxylates the quinone resulting in a carbonate salt.37 Upon the first reduction of a quinone molecule, a semiquinone radical anion is produced. Some semiquinones, with sufficient electron density, i.e. sufficient Lewis base strength, can react with CO2 in a nucleophilic addition to form a carbonate salt. Semiquinones with lower electron density â€“ due to attached electron withdrawing groups â€“ do not have the nucleophilic strength to react with CO2.38 A semiquinone carboxylated by the reductive addition of CO2 has its negative charge isolated from the rest of the molecule by a Ïƒ-bond, rendering the carboxylated quinone aromatic ring(s) relatively neutral. Hence, the two-electron reduction of the parent quinone under CO2 occurs at the first reduction potential. The second reduction generates another nucleophilic center, i.e. the second oxygen of the quinone, which reacts with a second CO2 molecule to form a bis(carbonate) dianion salt â€“ the quinol dianion diadduct. A similar behavior is observed when quinones are reduced in protic electrolyte media and the reduced quinones react with protons to form two hydroxyl groups via a two-electron reduction.39\n",

      "(a) Two single-electron reduction waves of anthraquinone in the absence of electrophiles. (b) One two-electron reduction wave of anthraquinone in the presence of CO2.\n",
      "The nucleophilic addition reaction of reduced quinones occurs only with electrophiles with sufficient Lewis acidity, such as CO2, and not N2, hence the great selectivity in adsorption. Furthermore, water, in the treated gas stream, has minimal effect on carbon capture, mainly because the hydrophobicity of the IL used presents a considerable mass transfer resistance for water with very little retention,40 and any residual water in the IL phase merely stabilizes the reduced quinones,41 with no significant change to the electrochemical or chemical steps of the carbon capture process.20 While the presence of oxygen can cause the oxidation of some reduced quinones with a sufficiently negative reduction potential, through the formation of the superoxide radical anion O2Ë™âˆ’, it is possible to avoid any reactions with oxygen in the feed stream by carefully tuning the electron density of the quinone polymer.42\n",
      "The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the PAQâ€“CNT composite on the electrode substrate in [Bmim][TF2N] saturated with N2, the green line in Fig. 3, shows two redox couples corresponding to the two reduction potentials of anthraquinone. The cathodic and anodic peaks, however, are broader than those reported for solutions of quinone molecules in electrolytes,20 which can be ascribed to the slower electron exchange between differently-reduced redox units, i.e. neutral quinone, semiquinone (radical anion) and quinol dianion, along the Ï€-conjugated backbone of the polymer,43 and also to the diffusion and electromigration of electrolytic species into and out of the porous PAQâ€“CNT film.44 The expected disappearance of the second redox couple of the CV under CO2 was observed, as shown by the red line in Fig. 3, and attributed to the carboxylation of the reduced quinone units along the polymer chain facilitating the second electron reduction of anthraquinone at the first reduction potential, with the consequent increase in the current at that potential. The PAQâ€“CNT electrode can therefore be used to remove CO2 selectively from a gas mixture via nucleophilic addition, and regenerated via an electrochemical oxidation, with release of the CO2, as shown earlier. The two reduction potentials under N2 are E01 = âˆ’1.21 V and E02 = âˆ’1.63 V, vs. Fc. Under CO2 these two potentials coalesce to yield a single quasi-reversible redox couple at the first reduction potential observed under N2, i.e. E01.\n",
      "The separation of the oxidation and reduction peaks in the CVs reported is large, indicating sluggish electron transfer to the quinone repeat units on the polymer, and a thick diffusion layer in the porous electrode.44 While the ratio of polymer to CNT was optimized for the greatest gravimetric capacity, it is not the ideal ratio for conductivity. Some of the conductivity takes place through the backbone of the polymer, which contributes to the slow electron transfer. This, however, does not present a problem in the design of the contactor separation unit, since the rate limiting step in the CO2 capture process is the transport of CO2 and not electron transfer.\n",
      "The double carboxylation (CO2 addition) of anthraquinone to form the bis(carbonate) dianion follows an ECEC mechanism, as shown in Scheme 2(a). During a constant-current charging of the cell in the presence of a flux of CO2 towards the quinone units equal to, or higher than, the rate of the electrochemical reduction of the quinones, both of the reduction electrochemical reactions take place at the first reduction potential, E01. The molar flux of CO2, NCO2, towards the electrode (moles per unit area per second) should match the current density, J, at the electrode (charge per unit area per second), as in,Â (3)Conversely, if the flux of CO2 is lower than the rate of reduction, some of the semiquinones produced in the first reduction are not carboxylated but are instead reduced to quinol dianions at the more negative second potential, E02, as shown in Scheme 2(b). In this case, for the same number of moles of semiquinone being reduced, and hence electrons, i.e. charge, transferred, more energy is required in accordance with eqn (2).\n",

      "CO2 deprivation was not a problem in the highly saturated electrolyte in the CV electrochemical characterizations, where the concentration of CO2 in the electrolyte was about 20 times higher than that of the quinones on the electrode. However, in an adsorption system, where the electrolyte is not saturated with CO2 there needs to be a careful balance between the advective and diffusive fluxes of CO2 towards the anthraquinone cathodes for reductive addition, and the rate of the reduction of anthraquinone. This can be better controlled by charging the cell, i.e. reducing the anthraquinone, at a constant potential that is sufficient to drive the first reduction of anthraquinone but not the second, i.e. charging the cell at a potential difference that is between Î”V1 and Î”V2. With operation at this constant potential, the flux of CO2 does not affect the energy of binding, since the second electron is acquired by a semiquinone at the first reduction potential, but only after the first CO2 addition occurs; following this second reduction, a second CO2 molecule can bind to the dianion monoadduct. When the first reduction is allowed in a CO2-lean environment at a constant potential, the current observed after the initial surge, which results from the first reduction, is proportional to the flux of CO2 towards the anthraquinone electrode. Nevertheless, this current ultimately diminishes due to the decrease in the number of semiquinones available to react with CO2. In a CO2-rich environment, at constant potential charging, the observed current after the initial surge is proportional to the transport of CO2 into the electrode and the rate of the addition reaction which follows the nucleophilic addition mechanism between semiquinones and dissolved CO2,Â R = kCQË™âˆ’CCO2,IL(4)where R is the rate of the reaction and k is the rate constant. The electrochemical steps proceed at a faster rate than the chemical reactions, but both types of reactions have rates that are faster than the rate of diffusion of CO2 in the IL, leading to a large DamkÃ¶hler number,Â (5)where CQ is the initial concentration of anthraquinone repeat units on the electrode, CCO2 is the concentration of CO2 in the IL, L is the thickness of the IL-wetted porous electrode, which is about 150 Î¼m, and DCO2,IL is the diffusion coefficient of CO2 in the IL and is about 4 Ã— 10âˆ’10 m2 sâˆ’1. While it is the semiquinone that participates in the reaction here, the initial concentration CQ is a good approximation for estimating the order of magnitude of Da. The rate constant can be estimated to be 102 Mâˆ’1 sâˆ’1,37 resulting in Da âˆ¼104. Large values of Da indicate that mass transfer will control the process and thus the charging and subsequent carboxylation of the quinones can be assumed to be in equilibrium with the prevailing CO2 concentration at any position and at any time. Therefore, with a reduced thickness of the electrodes, the CO2 mass transfer rates will approach that of the nucleophilic addition reaction.\n",

      ", Accepted 30th September 2019First published on 1st October 2019AbstractCarbon capture is one of the foremost methods for curtailing greenhouse gas emissions. Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinoneâ€“carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40â€“90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\n",
      "Broader context\n",
      "There is a clear scientific consensus on the role of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the unusually wild fluctuations of global climate patterns over the last century, to which carbon dioxide is the largest contributor. This has generated a scientific tide in the study of carbon removal techniques over the last three decades, which has slowly gathered momentum, culminating in the 2015 Paris Agreement, which heavily emphasized the role of carbon removal by tackling emissions or via negative emissions technologies. While a path forward for carbon capture is being shaped by a mix of incumbent actors and newcomers, the great majority of the proposed processes rely on conventional concepts. Moreover, most of these processes have a large balance of plant which hinders their potential to flexibly adapt to the multi-scale nature of carbon capture. Herein, we demonstrate a new approach which presents a paradigm shift in adsorption type processes and carbon capture. The electro-swing basis of our process allows its linear scaling with desired capacity and lends it geometric flexibility. It also allows carbon capture from streams of any concentration, and its release into any carrier streams, including pure CO2, with a low balance of plant.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "With the alarming increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and its implications for global climate pattern developments,1,2 mitigation of climate change through curtailment of anthropogenic CO2 emissions has been one of the most urgent socioeconomic and scientific problems in the global arena over the last decade.3 To this end, a number of technologies have been developed for the large-scale capture of CO2 from combustion and other industrial processes to produce high-purity CO2 streams for storage or valorization.4 The most mature of these technologies are solvent scrubbing, mainly amine scrubbing,5 and oxyfuel combustion,6 which target high CO2 concentration streams (>10%). These approaches have a large footprint and, when retrofitted to a process, can require major modifications to the plant. Consequently, there has been a major effort to develop new materials and processes for high efficiency CO2-capture, including sorbents for pressure and temperature swing adsorption systems,7 and membranes for selective transport of the CO2.8 Furthermore, many potential applications of carbon capture require compact devices due to space limitations, such as in the direct capture of CO2 from tailpipe exhausts on board mobile sources, in which there is growing interest given the large contribution of transportation exhaust to greenhouse gas emissions (33.5% of U.S. CO2 emissions in 2016).9\n",
      "In addition to the capture of CO2 from direct combustion processes, there is a need to remove CO2 from enclosed spaces for ventilation purposes in buildings and car cabins, or for cabin environmental control systems on board spacecraft and submarines, where the maximum allowed CO2 concentration in habitable spaces is 5000 ppm (or 0.5%).10 The first of such systems was developed by Winnick et al., for the electrochemical capture of CO2 in spacecraft cabins using molten carbonates.11 However, the low concentration of CO2 in such applications poses a challenge, mainly due to the low driving forces for mass transfer and the large quantities of other species present in air in addition to CO2.12 Thus, carbon capture is a multi-scale problem, where the CO2-rich streams to be treated vary greatly in volume, concentration and composition, and different criteria need to be fulfilled to ensure optimal processing depending on whether sources are industrial or small-scale (e.g., power plants or oil and gas heaters), concentrated or dilute (exhausts from combustion or air in confined spaces), and clean or contaminated with other pollutants.\n",
      "Many of the CO2-capture chemical processes that involve a capture agent such as amines or solid sorbents require temperature and/or pressure swings to release the captured CO2 and regenerate the agents for further capture. These swings result in inefficiencies due to energy wasted in heating solvents and sorbents, pressurizing feed gas, or drawing a vacuum for desorption. Electrochemical systems can minimize such parasitic energy losses as they can be operated at near isothermal conditions, with significantly higher efficiencies than their thermal-swing (TSA) and pressure-swing (PSA) adsorption counterparts.13 One mode of electrochemical capture of CO2 is through the use of a redox-active carrier.\n",
      "Electrochemically mediated selective transport of chemical species was first reported by Ward et al.,14 where a redox-active carrier (ferrous ion) was used to transport nitric oxide across a membrane. Since then, a number of systems have been developed for transporting chemical species by redox-active carriers that are activated at one electrode, to bind with the target species, and deactivated at the opposite electrode, to release the target and regenerate the carrier.15,16 Systems that have been proposed for the concentration of CO2 through this approach have been based on a number of different carrier molecules, such as quinones,17â€“20 4,4â€²-bipyridine,21 and thiolates.22,23 Quinones are of particular interest to this work for their superior electrochemical performance, serving as redox-active carriers for CO2 in electrochemically mediated separation processes. DuBois et al. demonstrated this possibility, and studied the thermodynamics of an electrochemical CO2 pumping system that utilizes quinones.18 More work followed, where Scovazzo et al. demonstrated the electrochemical separation of CO2 from <1% concentration gas mixtures using 2,6-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone as a carrier in ionic liquid (IL) and organic solvent electrolytes media,19 while Gurkan et al. screened a number of ILs to serve as suitable electrolytes for quinone carriers in an electrochemically mediated selective transport system for CO2.20 All of these systems, however, require the transport of the electrolyte and the dissolved carrier molecules between two electrodes in an electrochemical cell for capture and release of CO2. This limits their implementation in a number of applications where the requirement for flow systems and pumping, and the large footprint, are problematic.\n",
      "In this work, we develop a compact electrochemical device for CO2 capture that eliminates the requirement for complex flow systems, and that can be effective in the treatment of both high and low concentration feed streams. A quinone-utilizing faradaic electrochemical cell that fulfils these requirements and operates as an Electro-Swing Adsorption (ESA) process is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. The cell is comprised of two cathode electrode substrates coated with a CO2-binding quinoneâ€“carbon nanotube (Qâ€“CNT) composite sandwiching an anode electrode substrate coated with a ferroceneâ€“CNT (Fcâ€“CNT) composite, with separator membranes between the electrodes. This cell architecture is employed to maximize the CO2-binding surface area of the cell exposed to gas flow in a parallel passage adsorbent contactor design where stacks of these cells form parallel gas channels. The Fcâ€“CNT electrode serves as an electron source and sink for the reduction and oxidation, respectively, of the Qâ€“CNT electrodes to regulate the uptake and release of the CO2. Wetting of porous non-woven carbon fiber mats used as the electrode substrates by a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) electrolyte enables effective ionic currents to pass through the electrolyte on activation and deactivation of the electrodes, and permits the diffusion of CO2 into the electrolyte-wetted cathodes during capture.\n",

      "Schematic of a single electro-swing adsorption electrochemical cell with porous electrodes and electrolyte separators. The outer electrodes, coated with poly-1,4-anthraquinone composite, can capture CO2 on application of a reducing potential via carboxylation of quinone, and release the CO2 on reversal of the polarity. The inner polyvinylferrocene-containing electrode serves as an electron source and sink for the quinone reduction and oxidation, respectively.\n",
      "The effectiveness of the electro-swing concept for CO2 capture and release was demonstrated in a sealed system in which cell polarity was cycled to regulate the activation and deactivation of the carrier, i.e. reduction and oxidation of the redox active quinone. This was in lieu of the advection of the carrier electrolyte solution between two electrodes with a difference in potential.19 The performance of flow-through modules constructed with stacks of the assembled electrode cells was also assessed. The CO2 capture processes were modelled to provide greater insight into the operational principles for this technology.\n",
      "Ultimately, the goal of this work was to demonstrate an electrochemically activated packed parallel passage contactor adsorption system for the removal of CO2 from flue gas and other CO2-rich streams. The regeneration of the bed takes place on reversal of the polarity of the stack in an ESA, with analogies to PSA systems, where adsorption takes place at high pressure and desorption at a lower pressure,24 or TSA systems, where adsorption takes place at low temperatures and the fixed bed is regenerated at higher temperatures.25\n",
      "Results and discussion\n",
      "Design of the electrochemical cell\n",
      "Thin films of crystallized organic compounds have been studied as a means of immobilizing CO2 redox-active carriers onto electrode substrates.26 Redox-active polymers have long been the preferred electrode material when using organic molecules in electrochemical cells, however, because polymers are less soluble in the electrolyte than their corresponding redox-active repeating units, and thus the self-discharge of the cell can be avoided, and its cycling performance improved.27 For example, quinone polymers have been investigated as suitable cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries,28 and pseudocapacitive energy storage devices.29 These polymers are usually made into composites with conductive high-surface area carbon materials, such as carbon black, graphite or carbon nanotubes (CNT), to enhance the overall conductivity of the electrode material and increase the area of the polymer exposed to the electrolyte.30 Here, we used a polyanthraquinoneâ€“CNT (PAQâ€“CNT) composite for the cathode and polyvinylferroceneâ€“CNT (PVFcâ€“CNT) composite for the anode.31 The electrolyte used was the RTIL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bmim][TF2N]), selected for its low volatility, which allows for flow of gas over the wetted electrodes without loss of electrolyte to evaporation or entrainment.\n",
      "A sealed chamber was constructed in which CO2 capture and release on electrochemical activation and deactivation of the quinones, respectively, was indicated by the concomitant pressure changes in the chamber. A flow cell was also fabricated to house stacks of the electrochemical cells to allow for capture of CO2 from flowing gas streams of compositions similar to those of flue gases, air in aircraft cabins and buildings, and in the ambient environment. The adsorption effectiveness was assessed through analysis of the breakthrough profiles.\n",
      "The chemical specificity of quinones can provide near 100% purity of released CO2, which, when combined with a well-designed process in which 100% CO2 recovery is achieved, puts the technology much closer to the upper-right corner on the recovery-purity Pareto plot than those based on current CO2 sorbents.32,33\n",
      "Polyanthraquinone electrodes.\n",
      "Poly(1,4-anthraquinone) (P14AQ), shown in Fig. 1, was synthesized and incorporated into an ink with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Non-woven carbon fiber mat electrode substrates of thickness 150 Î¼m (35 g mâˆ’2) were dip-coated in the ink and dried very slowly to obtain a composite that uniformly coated the substrate at âˆ¼1.2 mg cmâˆ’2, shown in Fig. 2(a). The composite structure allows for a greater utilization of the anthraquinone repeating units in the polymers, and thus larger currents under applied potentials. The CNT mesh, shown in Fig. 2(f), provides a backbone to improve the conductivity of the conjugated PAQ via Ï€â€“Ï€ interactions with the anthraquinone units (Fig. S3, ESIâ€ ); it also provides a porous matrix decorated by the polymer chains for better electrolyte penetration. This results in a larger surface area of the polymer being exposed to electrolyte, and an increased conductivity in the composite.34 The Ï€â€“Ï€ interaction of the polymer chains and CNTs, and the subsequent decoration of the nanotubes with the polymer chains, shown in Fig. 2(e), also improved the suspension of the CNTs in the polymer solution, which resulted in very well dispersed inks. The ratio of PAQ to CNT was optimized, with the highest current per mass of active material (polymer) obtained at a 1:3, PAQ:CNT ratio by weight (Fig. S4, ESIâ€ ). The cyclic voltammograms in Fig. 3 shown in green (under N2) and red (under CO2) indicate the strong redox activity of these electrode surfaces; the differences in the current response following potential scans are discussed later.\n",

      "A counter electrode with a reduction potential more positive than the oxidative CO2 release potential of PAQâ€“CNT is required to make an electrochemical cell that can effectively capture and release CO2. Therefore, the anode electrode material for the electrochemical cell with PAQâ€“CNT cathode was a composite of polyvinylferrocene and CNT (PVFcâ€“CNT), shown in Fig. 1. This was prepared by dispersing MWCNTs in a solution of PVFc in NMP. The optimum ratio of the composite was found to be 1:1, PVFc:CNT, by weight. The electrode substrate was dip-coated in the ink and dried slowly to yield a composite that uniformly coated the substrate at âˆ¼1.4 mg cmâˆ’2, as shown in Fig. 4. The CVs of the PVFcâ€“CNT electrode in N2 and CO2 saturated [Bmim][TF2N] are identical, and are indicated by the blue line in Fig. 3.

      "The electrochemical cell.\n",
      "The PAQâ€“CNT electrodes were assembled into an electrochemical cell in which CO2 was able to be captured and released upon potential swings. This was accomplished by layering a PVFcâ€“CNT counter electrode between the two PAQâ€“CNT electrodes to balance the charge of these electrodes, as shown in Fig. 5(d). In a CO2-rich environment, this afforded a polymer-based battery with an electrochemical window of âˆ¼1.2 V, where all the charge from the ferrocene oxidation, at its reduction potential, was balanced by the charge transferred to the two-electron reduction of quinone, at its first reduction potential. This window is defined by the reduction potential of PVFcâ€“CNT and the first reduction potential of PAQâ€“CNT, shown in Fig. 3 as Î”V1. However, in the absence of CO2 or other such electrophiles, mainly under N2, PAQ retains its two one-electron reductions, with half of the charge of the ferrocene oxidation being balanced by the reduction of quinone at the first potential and the other half by its reduction at the second potential. This results in a wider electrochemical window, shown in Fig. 3 as Î”V2, and the behavior of the cell resembles that of an asymmetric pseudocapacitor.35\n",

      "The capacities of the anode and cathodes of the cell, evaluated by gravimetric charge calibration of the two electrode composite materials (Fig. S5, ESIâ€ ), were balanced by requiring that mP14AQâ€“CNT = 1.12mPFVcâ€“CNT, which allowed for some excess PVFcâ€“CNT.\n",
      "Carbon capture\n",
      "Two different types of units were fabricated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the electro-swing process. The first was a sealed chamber into which the electrodes were inserted. Changes in pressure were measured as CO2 was adsorbed and then released on cycling of the potential applied to the electrodes. The second approach used a flow adsorption in which the CO2 exiting the device was monitored, with the breakthrough point reflecting the overall capacity of the electrodes. All carbon capture experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "CO2 capture and release in a batch system.\n",
      "An electrochemical cell (4 cm2 of total exposed area) with the three layers, such as that illustrated in Fig. 1, was tested for the capture and release of CO2 in a sealed chamber, shown in Fig. 5. This cell had âˆ¼4.8 mg of PAQâ€“CNT deposited, i.e. 5.8 Î¼mol of quinone, or a capacity for 11.6 Î¼mol of CO2. From the monitored pressure changes in the chamber of known internal void volume, the number of moles of CO2 captured and released upon charge and discharge of the cell at constant potentials, were calculated. The chamber was purged with CO2 at the desired concentrations and sealed at atmospheric pressure. The pressure inside was allowed to equilibrate at constant temperature before the electrochemical experiments were started.\n",
      "The performance of the electrochemical cell was evaluated in chronoamperometric (potentiostatic) experiments, with capture at 1.3 V and release at 0.5 V, i.e. Î”V = 0.8 V. Fig. 6(a) shows the change in the number of moles of CO2 captured from pure gas over 10 cycles (blue), along with the charge transferred to and from the cell (red). It shows that âˆ¼65% of the quinone units were utilized, i.e. 7.4 Î¼mol of CO2 captured. This may be due to incomplete charging of the quinones that are not exposed to electrolyte. From the charge transferred during charging and discharge (âˆ¼800 mC), and the moles of CO2 captured and released, a faradaic efficiencyÂ (1)of up to 90% was estimated, with some of the charge lost to double layer charging of the porous electrodes. Here, F is Faraday's constant, Q is the charge transferred, and n is the number of moles of useful electrons transferred in the reaction, i.e. used for the capture of CO2, which in this reaction, is equivalent to the number of moles of CO2. This efficiency results in âˆ¼86 kJ per mole of CO2 captured and released, as determined by the relationÂ (2)where Î”V is the difference between the applied charge and discharge potentials.\n",

      "(a) Changes in the number of moles of CO2 captured upon charging and discharge of the electrochemical cell over 10 cycles, normalized by the moles of quinone on the electrode ().

(b) The CO2 captured under different feed concentrations. (c) Capacity of cell over 7000 cycles. In a different set of experiments using a larger cell and cavity, (d) shows the effect of varying charging potential for a 1000 s capture and (e) shows the effect of varying the capture duration at âˆ’1.8 V capture potential. These experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "Fig. 6(b) shows similar results for the capture of CO2 from gases of different concentrations ranging between 15 and 100%. Again, quinone utilization was high, but dependent on the initial gas concentration, owing not to capacity limitations, but to a reduction on sorption dynamics due to mass transfer limitations with lower concentration driving forces. The electrochemical cell showed great stability with <30% loss in capacity over 7000 cycles of capture and release, Fig. 6(c). The gradual loss in capacity is mainly due to the electromigration of the shorter polymer chains, Fig. S1 (ESIâ€ ), from the electrode and into the electrolyte, towards the opposite electrode.\n",
      "In a different set of experiments where a larger cell (âˆ¼450 cm2 of total exposed area) was used, CO2 transport limitations became more prominent due to the larger internal volume of the cavity used. In this set, the effect of applying an overpotential was studied, where capture potentials of greater than Î”V1 (in Fig. 3) were applied during a 1000 s capture experiment. Fig. 6(d) shows that upon increasing the applied capture potential more CO2 is captured for the duration of the experiment, which indicates the activation of more quinone units on the electrodes during the charging half-cycle. Charging the system at âˆ’1.8 V for varying durations, Fig. 6(e), shows that the system is fully charged after 2000 s, but more CO2 is captured, i.e. more of the quinones are utilized, at increasing durations of capture. This demonstrates the transport limitations of the electrodes, as explained in later sections.\n",
      "CO2 capture and release in flow systems.\n",
      "The adsorption bed assembled consisted of a few electrochemical cells stacked in the flow device to allow the flow of gas in between, as illustrated in Fig. 7(a). The blue regions indicate the presence of CO2, and the decrease in blue intensity within the channel indicates the adsorption front, ahead of which the bed is still empty, and behind which the bed, i.e. the electrode assembly, is saturated with CO2 and cannot adsorb more. A number of different cells were constructed in the flow bed configuration shown in Fig. 7(b). The exposed area of a typical cell was 18 cm Ã— 10 cm, with âˆ¼0.2 g of P14AQâ€“CNT composite; at âˆ¼70% useful quinones, this amounted to the adsorption of âˆ¼9â€“14 cm3 of CO2. The channels between the cells were typically âˆ¼500 Î¼m thick, and bed volumes were about 35 cm3 with a total bed weight of âˆ¼1.5 g bringing the productivity of the bed to 0.01â€“0.02 kg CO2 per kgbedtb, where tb is the breakthrough time, i.e. the time to reach saturation of the electrodes or for the outlet CO2 concentration to begin to increase. At feed flow rates of âˆ¼10 mL minâˆ’1 and 15% CO2, this productivity is on par with the TSA systems reported by Ntiamoah et al.36\n",

      "(a) Schematic illustration of the parallel passage electrochemical cell contactor. The blue region indicates the saturated zone and the development of the mass transfer zone. (b) Photograph of a flow bed with a stack of the electrochemical cells.\n",
      "It can be shown that axial flow dispersion within individual channels was minimal at most flow rates, and that the transport resistances resided primarily within the electrodes. Imperfect packing of the cells in the flow device by hand did, in some cases, lead to significant channeling and large-scale device axial dispersion, however, with broad breakthrough curves, but it is anticipated that under optimal manufacturing conditions these effects can be reduced significantly.\n",
      "The chronoamperometric experiments performed in the sealed system were repeated in a flow system. Mixtures of N2 and CO2 at different compositions were flown past the stack of assembled electrochemical cells. Upon reduction of the PAQâ€“CNT electrodes, CO2 was removed (captured) from the inlet stream, and the decrease in the concentration of CO2 was detected at the outlet stream. In these experiments the bed was fully activated by charging at a constant potential greater than Î”V22 to guarantee the complete reduction of the all accessible quinone units prior to adsorption. Experiments with an initial half activation, i.e., at Î”V1, followed by adsorption at constant potential, did not result in different breakthrough curves, mainly because the kinetics of the reduction and the adsorption reactions are much faster than the rates of mass transfer of CO2 into the film, as discussed later.\n",
      "The breakthrough profiles obtained for one flow system are shown in Fig. 8(a). Breakthrough was achieved at smaller bed volumes of gas treated for higher feed CO2 concentrations, where the bed volume is a time measure which represents the total volume of gas treated at any given time relative to the volume of the bed itself. The breakthrough curves superimpose when normalized by the inlet CO2 concentration, shown in Fig. 8(b), which indicates a consistent behavior of the bed, i.e. equal utilization of the overall adsorption capacity regardless of the inlet concentration, an indication of a rectangular equilibrium isotherm. Note in this particular module that, although the breakthrough curves themselves were sharp, prior to breakthrough there was a consistent effluent concentration of 20% of the feed concentration, the result of a bypassing of the active cells by 20% of the total gas flow. The overall capacity of the bed can be calculated from the area between the line at Cout/Cin = 1 and the normalized breakthrough curve. A contactor bed of a desired overall capacity can be designed by linear scaling from this overall capacity. With a larger bed, CO2 was fully captured from a stream at 10% inlet concentration, which is on the higher end for carbon capture applications as it mimics combustion exhaust. Up to 10 bed volumes of feed were treated before breakthrough was achieved, indicating capacity of greater than one bed volume of pure CO2. It has similarly been shown that complete removal of CO2 with a smaller stack of cells (a scaled down contactor), five replicate capture experiments were conducted on an inlet stream of âˆ¼0.8% CO2, Fig. 8(d), which mimics conditions for ventilation of confined living spaces, such as space modules, submarines and buildings. The breakthrough curves were unaffected by the prior history of the bed, indicating that complete regeneration and restoration of the bed capacity was attained during the desorption following each adsorption run.\n",

      "(a) Breakthrough profiles obtained at four inlet concentrations. (b) Same breakthrough profiles in (a) normalized by the inlet concentrations. (c) Breakthrough profile obtained from a large system operating at âˆ¼10% inlet concentration. (d) Breakthrough profiles obtained from five replicate runs of a smaller system operating at âˆ¼0.8% inlet concentration. These experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "The broadness of the breakthrough profiles in Fig. 8(c) and (d) can be attributed to the variation in channel width. Since the electrochemical cell stacks are hand-assembled and fitted into the bed, some variation in channel width along the same channel and the parallel channels can cause an uneven distribution of flow resulting in overlapping of multiple breakthrough profiles, which culminate in a broad overall profile. Also, mass-transfer dispersion plays a significant role in the broadness of the profiles. As is evident from the long durations for an effective capture in Fig. 6(e), and discussed later, mass transfer of CO2 into the electrodes is the rate controlling step, and this causes axial dispersion that widens the mass transfer zone in the channel, illustrated in Fig. 7(a), resulting in broad breakthrough profiles in this case.\n",
      "Mechanism of CO2 capture\n",
      "Mizen and Wrighton first demonstrated the reductive addition of CO2 to 9,10-phenanthrenequinone in aprotic electrolytes. Quinones undergo two reversible one-electron reductions in aprotic electrolytes, at two reduction potentials, as shown in Scheme 1(a) for anthraquinone. But in the presence of CO2, a single two-electron quasi-reversible reduction takes place at the first reduction potential, as shown in Scheme 1(b), where the CO2 molecule carboxylates the quinone resulting in a carbonate salt.37 Upon the first reduction of a quinone molecule, a semiquinone radical anion is produced. Some semiquinones, with sufficient electron density, i.e. sufficient Lewis base strength, can react with CO2 in a nucleophilic addition to form a carbonate salt. Semiquinones with lower electron density â€“ due to attached electron withdrawing groups â€“ do not have the nucleophilic strength to react with CO2.38 A semiquinone carboxylated by the reductive addition of CO2 has its negative charge isolated from the rest of the molecule by a Ïƒ-bond, rendering the carboxylated quinone aromatic ring(s) relatively neutral. Hence, the two-electron reduction of the parent quinone under CO2 occurs at the first reduction potential. The second reduction generates another nucleophilic center, i.e. the second oxygen of the quinone, which reacts with a second CO2 molecule to form a bis(carbonate) dianion salt â€“ the quinol dianion diadduct. A similar behavior is observed when quinones are reduced in protic electrolyte media and the reduced quinones react with protons to form two hydroxyl groups via a two-electron reduction.39\n",

      "(a) Two single-electron reduction waves of anthraquinone in the absence of electrophiles. (b) One two-electron reduction wave of anthraquinone in the presence of CO2.\n",
      "The nucleophilic addition reaction of reduced quinones occurs only with electrophiles with sufficient Lewis acidity, such as CO2, and not N2, hence the great selectivity in adsorption. Furthermore, water, in the treated gas stream, has minimal effect on carbon capture, mainly because the hydrophobicity of the IL used presents a considerable mass transfer resistance for water with very little retention,40 and any residual water in the IL phase merely stabilizes the reduced quinones,41 with no significant change to the electrochemical or chemical steps of the carbon capture process.20 While the presence of oxygen can cause the oxidation of some reduced quinones with a sufficiently negative reduction potential, through the formation of the superoxide radical anion O2Ë™âˆ’, it is possible to avoid any reactions with oxygen in the feed stream by carefully tuning the electron density of the quinone polymer.42\n",
      "The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the PAQâ€“CNT composite on the electrode substrate in [Bmim][TF2N] saturated with N2, the green line in Fig. 3, shows two redox couples corresponding to the two reduction potentials of anthraquinone. The cathodic and anodic peaks, however, are broader than those reported for solutions of quinone molecules in electrolytes,20 which can be ascribed to the slower electron exchange between differently-reduced redox units, i.e. neutral quinone, semiquinone (radical anion) and quinol dianion, along the Ï€-conjugated backbone of the polymer,43 and also to the diffusion and electromigration of electrolytic species into and out of the porous PAQâ€“CNT film.44 The expected disappearance of the second redox couple of the CV under CO2 was observed, as shown by the red line in Fig. 3, and attributed to the carboxylation of the reduced quinone units along the polymer chain facilitating the second electron reduction of anthraquinone at the first reduction potential, with the consequent increase in the current at that potential. The PAQâ€“CNT electrode can therefore be used to remove CO2 selectively from a gas mixture via nucleophilic addition, and regenerated via an electrochemical oxidation, with release of the CO2, as shown earlier. The two reduction potentials under N2 are E01 = âˆ’1.21 V and E02 = âˆ’1.63 V, vs. Fc. Under CO2 these two potentials coalesce to yield a single quasi-reversible redox couple at the first reduction potential observed under N2, i.e. E01.\n",
      "The separation of the oxidation and reduction peaks in the CVs reported is large, indicating sluggish electron transfer to the quinone repeat units on the polymer, and a thick diffusion layer in the porous electrode.44 While the ratio of polymer to CNT was optimized for the greatest gravimetric capacity, it is not the ideal ratio for conductivity. Some of the conductivity takes place through the backbone of the polymer, which contributes to the slow electron transfer. This, however, does not present a problem in the design of the contactor separation unit, since the rate limiting step in the CO2 capture process is the transport of CO2 and not electron transfer.\n",
      "The double carboxylation (CO2 addition) of anthraquinone to form the bis(carbonate) dianion follows an ECEC mechanism, as shown in Scheme 2(a). During a constant-current charging of the cell in the presence of a flux of CO2 towards the quinone units equal to, or higher than, the rate of the electrochemical reduction of the quinones, both of the reduction electrochemical reactions take place at the first reduction potential, E01. The molar flux of CO2, NCO2, towards the electrode (moles per unit area per second) should match the current density, J, at the electrode (charge per unit area per second), as in,Â (3)Conversely, if the flux of CO2 is lower than the rate of reduction, some of the semiquinones produced in the first reduction are not carboxylated but are instead reduced to quinol dianions at the more negative second potential, E02, as shown in Scheme 2(b). In this case, for the same number of moles of semiquinone being reduced, and hence electrons, i.e. charge, transferred, more energy is required in accordance with eqn (2).\n",

      "CO2 deprivation was not a problem in the highly saturated electrolyte in the CV electrochemical characterizations, where the concentration of CO2 in the electrolyte was about 20 times higher than that of the quinones on the electrode. However, in an adsorption system, where the electrolyte is not saturated with CO2 there needs to be a careful balance between the advective and diffusive fluxes of CO2 towards the anthraquinone cathodes for reductive addition, and the rate of the reduction of anthraquinone. This can be better controlled by charging the cell, i.e. reducing the anthraquinone, at a constant potential that is sufficient to drive the first reduction of anthraquinone but not the second, i.e. charging the cell at a potential difference that is between Î”V1 and Î”V2. With operation at this constant potential, the flux of CO2 does not affect the energy of binding, since the second electron is acquired by a semiquinone at the first reduction potential, but only after the first CO2 addition occurs; following this second reduction, a second CO2 molecule can bind to the dianion monoadduct. When the first reduction is allowed in a CO2-lean environment at a constant potential, the current observed after the initial surge, which results from the first reduction, is proportional to the flux of CO2 towards the anthraquinone electrode. Nevertheless, this current ultimately diminishes due to the decrease in the number of semiquinones available to react with CO2. In a CO2-rich environment, at constant potential charging, the observed current after the initial surge is proportional to the transport of CO2 into the electrode and the rate of the addition reaction which follows the nucleophilic addition mechanism between semiquinones and dissolved CO2,Â R = kCQË™âˆ’CCO2,IL(4)where R is the rate of the reaction and k is the rate constant. The electrochemical steps proceed at a faster rate than the chemical reactions, but both types of reactions have rates that are faster than the rate of diffusion of CO2 in the IL, leading to a large DamkÃ¶hler number,Â (5)where CQ is the initial concentration of anthraquinone repeat units on the electrode, CCO2 is the concentration of CO2 in the IL, L is the thickness of the IL-wetted porous electrode, which is about 150 Î¼m, and DCO2,IL is the diffusion coefficient of CO2 in the IL and is about 4 Ã— 10âˆ’10 m2 sâˆ’1. While it is the semiquinone that participates in the reaction here, the initial concentration CQ is a good approximation for estimating the order of magnitude of Da. The rate constant can be estimated to be 102 Mâˆ’1 sâˆ’1,37 resulting in Da âˆ¼104. Large values of Da indicate that mass transfer will control the process and thus the charging and subsequent carboxylation of the quinones can be assumed to be in equilibrium with the prevailing CO2 concentration at any position and at any time. Therefore, with a reduced thickness of the electrodes, the CO2 mass transfer rates will approach that of the nucleophilic addition reaction.\n",

      "Carbon capture is one of the foremost methods for curtailing greenhouse gas emissions. Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\n",

In the first two electrochemical reactions shown in Scheme 2(a), the reduced species are QË™âˆ’ and Q(CO2)2âˆ’, while the species of higher oxidation number in these two reactions are Q and Q(CO2)Ë™âˆ’ respectively. The standard reduction potential for both reactions is E01. While the first of the two electrochemical reactions in Scheme 2(b) is the same as that of Scheme 2(a), the second reaction has Q2âˆ’ as the reduced species and QË™âˆ’ as the species with higher oxidation number, with a standard reduction potential of E02. Likewise, in the anode oxidation reaction, Fc+ (ferrocenium) is the oxidized species and Fc (ferrocene) is the reduced species at E0 = âˆ’0.03 V. The current densities of these reactions were described by the Butlerâ€“Volmer equation,Â (7)where Î· is the overpotential and Î±, the symmetry factor, was approximated to be 0.5 for all the electrochemical reactions. The exchange current, i0, is given byÂ i0 = k0[red]Î±[ox](1âˆ’Î±)(8)The governing mass transfer equations for all the species involved in the electrochemical reaction, including the supporting electrolyte cations and anions, isÂ (9)where Ci is the concentration of the species, Ri is the rate of reaction in which the species is involved and Ni is the flux, which is zero for all immobilized faradaic species: anthraquinone in its different oxidation and binding states, and ferrocene.

The current density can be obtained from the flux of charged mobile species in the electrolyteÂ (11)and the overall electroneutrality is maintained by ensuring thatÂ (12)The boundary conditions for these equations are ground (Î¦ = 0 V) for the anthraquinone electrode (colored grey in Fig. 9), and either constant current or constant potential at the ferrocene electrode (pink). The electrochemical model is the same for both sealed and flow systems, although the transport of CO2 in the gas phase (shown as a transparent block) is different in the two scenarios.\n",

      "In the sealed system, CO2 transport occurs via diffusion toward the electrode only, while in flow CO2 is also advected down the channel. In the sealed system, the partial pressure of the gas decreases during capture, while in flow the CO2 concentration changes along the gas channel with time, and the concentration of the gas leaving the device is a measure of the total effectiveness of the adsorption bed capacity and transport and kinetic limitations within the system. The total transport of CO2 is modelled by transport equations in each of the two phases, gas and IL. In the gas phase, the mass transfer governing equation in the sealed system is given byÂ (13)where CCO2,gas is the concentration of CO2 in the gas phase, obtained from its partial pressure and the ideal gas law. This governing equation has a no-flux boundary condition at the three wallsÂ (14)and at the gasâ€“IL interface, the fluxes normal to the interface are set to be equalÂ (15)where CCO2,IL is the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the IL phase. In the flow system, the flux of CO2 has an advective component as well and the governing equation becomesÂ (16)where u is the velocity of the gas flowing in the channel. The inlet is set at a constant concentration inflow and the outlet at zero gauge pressure. The mass transfer governing equation for dissolved CO2 in the IL phase, for both sealed and flow systems, is given byÂ (17)where R is a bulk reaction term describing the rate of the chemical reactions shown in Scheme 2(a). Simple rate equations, first order in all reactants, are used. A no-flux boundary condition is set at the walls. At the gasâ€“electrode interface, the concentration of dissolved CO2 is set toÂ CCO2,IL = Î²CCO2,gas(18)where Î² is the adjusted Henry's constant which accounts for the equilibrium partition of CO2 between the gas and IL phases.\n",

      "The simulation of constant-current charging at 0â€“5% CO2 concentrations in the sealed system in which the gas channel shown in Fig. 9 served as a gas headspace, shows results that are consistent with the aforementioned mechanism of CO2 capture. In addition to the cell voltage, the concentrations of all the cathode quinonic species were studied during the charging process. Fig. 10 shows the cell voltages at 0â€“5% CO2 and the concentration profiles of cathode species at 0, 2, and 5% CO2. The cell voltage profiles in Fig. 10(a) show that as the concentration of CO2 increases, less of the cell charging occurs at the higher potential. At 0% CO2 the cell simply traverses both reduction potentials of the quinone, and the species profiles in Fig. 10(b) show two consecutive conversions; the first is the reduction of quinone to semiquinone, and the second is the reduction of semiquinone to quinol dianion. The second reaction starts only after all the quinone is converted to semiquinone, and to further accommodate the incoming electrons at the constant current, the second, more energetic reduction takes place until all faradaic reactions are exhausted. Here, the simulation was stopped just short of full conversion to avoid numerical complications that arise from the exhaustion of faradaic material, i.e. complete charging. At 2% CO2, upon generation of the semiquinone, shown in Fig. 10(c), the modest diffusive flux of CO2 allows for the formation of the semiquinone monoadduct which soon accepts a second electron at the first reduction potential of quinone, hence extending the cell charging period spent at the lower potential. This dianion monoadduct can then react with a second CO2 molecule, to form the dianion diadduct. But, upon the depletion of CO2 in the vicinity of the cathode, due to a charging rate that is faster than the diffusive flux of CO2 into the electrolyte at 2% headspace concentration, the semiquinone is converted to the dianion at the higher second potential, while the concentrations of the dianion monoadduct and the dianion diadduct remain constant. This is reflected in the potential profile at 2% CO2 in Fig. 10(a). However, at 5% CO2, the diffusive flux of CO2 is adequate, and barely any semiquinone can be detected since it is converted to semiquinone monoadduct, and other subsequent species, soon after generation, shown in Fig. 10(d). Here, all the electrochemical reactions take place at the first potential and none of the semiquinone is converted to quinol dianion.\n",

      "Hence, the optimum charging method of the cell, i.e. CO2 capture, is to operate at a constant potential just larger than the first potential window Î”V1. The greater the charging voltage, the faster the reduction reaction due to the larger overpotential. For practical reasons, and to avoid large current surges, the cell can be charged at a constant current until the desired charging potential difference is reached. This will be between Î”V1 and Î”V2 based on the rate of charging desired. At this point the bed is activated for capture by making half the total capture capacity available. Then the cell can be set at that constant potential until saturation of the cathodes is achieved. The second half of the capture capacity is made available as more CO2 flows in.\n",
      "It is also possible to fully activate the bed by charging at a potential difference Î”VHigh > Î”V1, at which point the cells are disconnected and allowed to saturate with no further supply of current, until breakthrough is achieved, and the bed is regenerated by discharging the cell and releasing pure CO2. The energy recovered however, cannot exceed QÎ”V1, resulting in an energy loss of greater than Q(Î”VHigh âˆ’ Î”V1).\n",
      "Model results for flow system.\n",
      "The model described above was also used to simulate the capture of CO2 from a channel under flow conditions. The gas flowed parallel to the electrodes in the cell, a cross-section of which is shown in Fig. 9. The simulated concentration profiles in the channel and the quinone electrode are shown as a function of the number of bed volumes in Fig. 11(a). The gas phase profiles are consistent with a dispersed plug flow in the channels, with a reasonably sharp adsorption front, while the linear CO2 profiles in the electrode are a result of the significant diffusional limitations in this region. Of particular interest is the depletion of unbound quinonic species in the cathode as removal of CO2 from the channel proceeds; as the cathode becomes saturated with CO2, the concentration of CO2 increases along the length of the channel until breakthrough is achieved at around 8 bed volumes, after which further saturation is allowed until the outlet concentration is equal to the inlet concentration at around 10 bed volumes. Fig. 11(b) and (c) show the breakthrough profiles as a function of cell voltage for a given feed concentration, and of feed concentration for a given cell voltage, respectively. The number of bed volumes required increases with decreasing feed concentrations, a result of the fixed overall bed capacity and the rectangular nature of the adsorption isotherm of this system. In the absence of transport and reaction limitations, all breakthrough curves should collapse when the bed volume is multiplied by the feed fraction of the adsorbate; the fact that this is not exactly so in Fig. 11(d) indicates that mass transfer limitations do play a role in the uptake of CO2 by the activated electrodes. Nevertheless, the overall capacity, indicated by the trapezoidal area under Cout/Cin = 1 and the breakthrough curves, remained constant. However, the effect of a stronger driving force on improved mass transfer is evident in Fig. 11(b), where at charging potentials that are closer to Î”V2, more of the dianion is generated in a Nernstian distribution, which provides two reaction sites for CO2. This results in a stronger driving force in the adsorption of CO2 and hence improved mass transfer, which yields a sharper breakthrough profile.\n",

      "Fig. 11(e) and (f) show the current across the electrochemical cell during the capture experiments in (c) and (b) respectively. Fig. 11(e) shows that at low potential charging, i.e. 1.3 V, an initial spike in current is observed which results from the reduction of the quinones on the electrodes to semiquinone, as explained earlier. This is followed by a region of constant current which is proportional to the flux of CO2 into the electrodes, since it reacts with the semiquinones and allows them to accept a second electron at the low potential. As the electrodes become saturated and all the semiquinone is depleted, the current decreases. This region of constant current followed by the sharp decrease is very broad for the 10% case, but much shorter for the 50% case, where there is a brief transition from the initial spike to the decreasing current region manifested in a shoulder. However, Fig. 11(f) shows that as the applied capture potential increases, the current profile for the same inlet concentration changes dramatically. This is elucidated in Scheme 3; as the applied potential approaches Î”V2, all of the quinone is reduced to semiquinone and a Nernstian distribution of semiquinone and quinol dianion is generated, evident by the increasing current in the first peak.\n",
      "Scheme 3\n",
      "The reduction of anthraquinone at a potential higher than its second reduction potential with a limited flux of CO2.\n",
      "Thus, CO2 reacts with the Nernstian mixture of semiquinone and quinol dianion, where in the case of the latter no further reaction, chemical or electrochemical, occurs, but in the case of the former a semiquinone monoadduct species is formed, which can be reduced to the dianion monoadduct at Î”V1. Therefore, the applied potential presents a large overpotential for this reaction, hence the second increase in the current which corresponds to the electron transfer for this reduction. Following these steps, all the quinone moieties in the electrodes are in their doubly charged states and no further electron transfer occurs. This double peak behavior of the current is the result of the balance between the rate of electron transfer and the flux of CO2, which relates to the earlier discussions. At charging potentials higher than Î”V2e.g. Î”VHigh, not shown here, a larger first peak is expected where all the quinone is converted to semiquinone then dianion, i.e. two consecutive single-electron reductions, after which the current drops to zero and only chemical addition reactions occur, Scheme 2(b).\n",
      "Energetic analysis of CO2 release\n",
      "The applied release potential determines the energy recovered from the cell upon the release of CO2, and must, therefore, be selected carefully. While quinones under N2 are expected to be reduced and oxidized reversibly without any significant loss of energy, in an electrophile-rich environment, such as CO2, the reduction is only quasi-reversible due to the energetic penalty of breaking a bond formed with CO2. Therefore, some of the energy is lost in the process, and it is imperative to minimize this loss, since it is directly related to energy per mole of CO2 concentrated (captured and released) in a CO2 capture process. The last step in the CO2 capture, Scheme 1(b), i.e. the addition of a second molecule of CO2 to the semiquinone monoadduct to form a dianion diadduct, is chemically irreversible for the duration of the cycle,37 and the release reaction takes place via an electrochemical oxidation of the diadduct. This oxidation occurs at a more positive potential than the first reduction potential E01. Thus, the more positive the release potential, the larger the overpotential and the faster and more complete is the release of the bound CO2. However, a more positive release voltage corresponds to less energy recovered during discharge, and thus more work done per cycle of capture and release, which is given by eqn (2).\n",
      "Consequently, to reduce energy losses per cycle, a less positive potential can be used in a constant potential discharge. While the capture cell voltage can be maintained at fairly minimal levels by setting it close to Î”V1, with some diminishment in rate, release at high cell voltages can result in a partial release of CO2, due to the partial oxidation of the bis(carbonate) quinone units (dianion diadduct units), and a subsequent underutilization of anthraquinone. After a few cycles of capture and release at a higher potential, a constant equilibrium rate of utilization of anthraquinone is achieved. This is akin to the working capacity of a pressure-swing adsorption system.45 Thus partial release can be achieved at higher cell discharge potentials as shown in Fig. 12. This allows for a much smaller window of operation, which at the âˆ¼90% faradaic efficiency reported earlier, an energy use of âˆ¼43 kJ molâˆ’1, with 60% utilization of accessible quinone is possible. This is on par with other carbon capture systems in efficiency and energy consumption,46,47 including thermal swing systems.48\n",
      "Fig. 12\n",
      "Fraction of CO2 released from the PAQâ€“CNT electrode with release voltage. At a constant capture cell voltage of 1.3 V, less of the bed is recovered with increasing release cell voltage, but the energy per mole of CO2 captured and released also decreases.\n",
      "Solid sorbent materials used in carbon capture applications have enthalpies of CO2 adsorption of the same order, e.g., Metalâ€“Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with 30â€“50 kJ molâˆ’1 for some types of MOF-74,49 and âˆ¼100 kJ molâˆ’1 for some amine functionalized MOFs,50 or zeolites, such as 13X at 40 kJ molâˆ’1.51 However, these are not process energetics but rather enthalpies of adsorption. Therefore, processes which are designed to utilize these materials incur greater energetic penalties associated with the techniques used for delivering the energy for desorption, i.e. heat and pressure change, whereas the energetics reported herein correspond to that of the process, which unlike those utilizing solid sorbents, has a binary affinity for CO2.\n",
      "Moreover, if a precise rate of release is desired, the cell can be discharged at a constant current. In this case, the flux of the released CO2 is proportional to the current density, as given by eqn (3). The discharge current and time, control the charge transferred, which is the extensive variable in the work of the process. This method of release is seldom utilized in swing adsorption processes, because it is the intensive, rather than the extensive variable, that is modulated, e.g., temperature in thermal swing, pressure in pressure swing, and, here, potential. Nevertheless, this can be useful for fast regeneration of the bed at high currents, where long periods of capture and short periods of release are desired. But due to the incomplete discharge of the electrochemical cells, in analogy with high current discharge of batteries,30 the bed will only be partially regenerated.\n",
      "Swing operations\n",
      "The electro-swing adsorption (ESA) technology developed in this work has a number of perceived advantages over other swing technologies such as temperature- (TSA) and pressure-swing (PSA) adsorption in terms of both its mode of operation and its thermodynamic adsorption characteristics, as illustrated in Fig. 13. Temperature-swing operations require heating and cooling of the entire adsorption matrix to release the adsorbed compounds, rather than just targeting the adsorption sites themselves, which introduces many thermal inefficiencies to the operation. The heating is typically accomplished with high-temperature steam as the sweep gas, with subsequent condensation of the steam to recover the pure CO2 product stream, whereas cooling is achieved during the blowdown phase in preparation for the next sorption cycle. With pressure-swing operations, the release of the captured material occurs on reduction of the adsorbate partial pressure in the sweep to reverse the mass transfer driving force, which can be achieved either by drawing a vacuum on the bed, or by using low pressure steam as the sweep gas. The product leaving the bed is dilute, and requires a second separation step, such as the condensation of steam, and external compression of the resulting CO2 to bring it to the desired pressures for subsequent utilization or for transportation and subsurface sequestration in geologic formations. Moreover, in both TSA and PSA operations, the working capacity is strongly dependent on the shape of the Langmuir- (or Freundlich-) type isotherm, with significantly lower capacities at lower concentrations, which limits the degree of regeneration of the adsorbent, or the partial pressure of the recovered adsorbate in the sweep stream. The electro-swing adsorbents, on the other hand, are characterized by a rectangular adsorption isotherm in which the saturation loading capacity in the activated state is independent of the gas phase concentration, so the adsorbent is equally effective over a wide range of feed concentrations from ambient conditions through to those characteristic of large scale power and industrial facilities. When deactivated, the adsorbent has negligible capacity for the CO2 even at high CO2 gas phase concentrations such that the working capacity of the adsorbent is independent of operating conditions. Thus, the sweep stream during the desorption process can be pure CO2 at the desired pressure, subject primarily to equipment design constraints, which greatly simplifies the adsorption/desorption cycle relative to those of the TSA and PSA processes. The results in Fig. 6(a) show that release into a pure CO2 gas environment is facile and fast, and complete if sufficient time is allowed to account for the kinetics of the process.\n",

      "Conclusions\n",
      "The electro-swing operations outlined in this paper offer a new approach to the exploitation of electrochemically mediated complexation of CO2 with redox-active species for the mitigation of CO2 emissions, and for control of CO2 levels in confined environments. Electro-swing adsorption has been shown to be equally effective, at a constant capacity, for the capture of CO2 at concentrations typical of fossil fuel combustion flue gases (âˆ¼10%) and in confined ambient environments (0.6â€“0.8%). These advances have been made possible by the development of new electrode materials in which redox-active moieties, such as quinones, that can bind CO2 in one oxidation state but not in another are immobilized onto the electrode substrates. These functionalized electrodes were incorporated into an electrochemical cell assembly to facilitate their cyclical electrochemical reduction and oxidation. The cells demonstrated exceptional capture and release of CO2 over more than 7000 cycles at 60â€“70% quinone utilization, 90% faradaic efficiency, and 90 kJ molâˆ’1 at 100% bed utilization and 43 kJ molâˆ’1 at 60%. A significant advantage of the quinone-functionalized electrodes is that they have a CO2 capacity that is essentially independent of the inlet feed concentration, in contrast to the capacities of sorbents typically used in PSA or TSA operations, where Langmuir-type equilibria limit capacity at lower concentrations.\n",
      "The strong performance of the electro-swing process allows for numerous applications where CO2 removal and/or storage is of interest. The ESA device can be easily integrated into processes in a plug-and-play fashion due to its simple design, and minimum requirement for ancillary equipment, primarily a regulated power source and sink (load). An initial techno-economic analysis (not reported here) shows that such carbon capture systems can be economically feasible with costs ranging from $50â€“$100 per tonne CO2 depending on the feed concentrations and applications under consideration.\n",
      "It is projected that further optimization of the ESA process can be obtained through refinement of the electrode chemistries and their assembly into compact adsorption devices to address a wide range of CO2 mitigation strategies.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Limited capacity: The system has a limited capacity for CO2 capture, as indicated by the rectangular adsorption isotherm. This limits the degree of regeneration of the adsorbent and the partial pressure of the recovered CO2 in the sweep stream.\n",
      "\n",

      "3. Energy losses during release: The release of CO2 from the system incurs energy losses due to the quasi-reversible nature of the reduction reaction in an electrophile-rich environment like CO2.

      "\n",
      "4. Partial release at high discharge potentials: High discharge potentials can result in partial release of CO2 due to the partial oxidation of the bis(carbonate) quinone units. This can lead to underutilization of anthraquinone and incomplete regeneration of the adsorption bed.\n",

While the first of the two electrochemical reactions in Scheme 2(b) is the same as that of Scheme 2(a), the second reaction has Q2âˆ’ as the reduced species and QË™âˆ’ as the species with higher oxidation number, with a standard reduction potential of E02. Likewise, in the anode oxidation reaction, Fc+ (ferrocenium) is the oxidized species and Fc (ferrocene) is the reduced species at E0 = âˆ’0.03 V. The current densities of these reactions were described by the Butlerâ€“Volmer equation,Â (7)where Î· is the overpotential and Î±, the symmetry factor, was approximated to be 0.5 for all the electrochemical reactions. The exchange current, i0, is given byÂ i0 = k0[red]Î±[ox](1âˆ’Î±)(8)The governing mass transfer equations for all the species involved in the electrochemical reaction, including the supporting electrolyte cations and anions, isÂ (9)where Ci is the concentration of the species, Ri is the rate of reaction in which the species is involved and Ni is the flux, which is zero for all immobilized faradaic species: anthraquinone in its different oxidation and binding states, and ferrocene. For mobile species, mainly the supporting electrolyte ions, the flux is given byÂ Ni = âˆ’Diâˆ‡Ci âˆ’ ziuiFCiâˆ‡Î¦(10)where zi is the valence, ui is the molar mobility, F is Faraday's constant and Î¦ is the electric potential. The current density can be obtained from the flux of charged mobile species in the electrolyteÂ (11)and the overall electroneutrality is maintained by ensuring thatÂ (12)The boundary conditions for these equations are ground (Î¦ = 0 V) for the anthraquinone electrode (colored grey in Fig. 9), and either constant current or constant potential at the ferrocene electrode (pink). The electrochemical model is the same for both sealed and flow systems, although the transport of CO2 in the gas phase (shown as a transparent block) is different in the two scenarios.\n",

      "In the sealed system, CO2 transport occurs via diffusion toward the electrode only, while in flow CO2 is also advected down the channel. In the sealed system, the partial pressure of the gas decreases during capture, while in flow the CO2 concentration changes along the gas channel with time, and the concentration of the gas leaving the device is a measure of the total effectiveness of the adsorption bed capacity and transport and kinetic limitations within the system. The total transport of CO2 is modelled by transport equations in each of the two phases, gas and IL. In the gas phase, the mass transfer governing equation in the sealed system is given byÂ (13)where CCO2,gas is the concentration of CO2 in the gas phase, obtained from its partial pressure and the ideal gas law. This governing equation has a no-flux boundary condition at the three wallsÂ (14)and at the gasâ€“IL interface, the fluxes normal to the interface are set to be equalÂ (15)where CCO2,IL is the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the IL phase. In the flow system, the flux of CO2 has an advective component as well and the governing equation becomesÂ (16)where u is the velocity of the gas flowing in the channel. The inlet is set at a constant concentration inflow and the outlet at zero gauge pressure. The mass transfer governing equation for dissolved CO2 in the IL phase, for both sealed and flow systems, is given byÂ (17)where R is a bulk reaction term describing the rate of the chemical reactions shown in Scheme 2(a). Simple rate equations, first order in all reactants, are used. A no-flux boundary condition is set at the walls. At the gasâ€“electrode interface, the concentration of dissolved CO2 is set toÂ CCO2,IL = Î²CCO2,gas(18)where Î² is the adjusted Henry's constant which accounts for the equilibrium partition of CO2 between the gas and IL phases.\n",

      "The simulation of constant-current charging at 0â€“5% CO2 concentrations in the sealed system in which the gas channel shown in Fig. 9 served as a gas headspace, shows results that are consistent with the aforementioned mechanism of CO2 capture. In addition to the cell voltage, the concentrations of all the cathode quinonic species were studied during the charging process. Fig. 10 shows the cell voltages at 0â€“5% CO2 and the concentration profiles of cathode species at 0, 2, and 5% CO2. The cell voltage profiles in Fig. 10(a) show that as the concentration of CO2 increases, less of the cell charging occurs at the higher potential. At 0% CO2 the cell simply traverses both reduction potentials of the quinone, and the species profiles in Fig. 10(b) show two consecutive conversions; the first is the reduction of quinone to semiquinone, and the second is the reduction of semiquinone to quinol dianion. The second reaction starts only after all the quinone is converted to semiquinone, and to further accommodate the incoming electrons at the constant current, the second, more energetic reduction takes place until all faradaic reactions are exhausted. Here, the simulation was stopped just short of full conversion to avoid numerical complications that arise from the exhaustion of faradaic material, i.e. complete charging. At 2% CO2, upon generation of the semiquinone, shown in Fig. 10(c), the modest diffusive flux of CO2 allows for the formation of the semiquinone monoadduct which soon accepts a second electron at the first reduction potential of quinone, hence extending the cell charging period spent at the lower potential. This dianion monoadduct can then react with a second CO2 molecule, to form the dianion diadduct. But, upon the depletion of CO2 in the vicinity of the cathode, due to a charging rate that is faster than the diffusive flux of CO2 into the electrolyte at 2% headspace concentration, the semiquinone is converted to the dianion at the higher second potential, while the concentrations of the dianion monoadduct and the dianion diadduct remain constant. This is reflected in the potential profile at 2% CO2 in Fig. 10(a). However, at 5% CO2, the diffusive flux of CO2 is adequate, and barely any semiquinone can be detected since it is converted to semiquinone monoadduct, and other subsequent species, soon after generation, shown in Fig. 10(d). Here, all the electrochemical reactions take place at the first potential and none of the semiquinone is converted to quinol dianion.\n",

      "Simulation of charging the electrochemical cell at different CO2 concentrations at constant current. (a) Potential difference of the cell. The change in concentration of quinone with charge is shown at (b) 0%, (c) 2% and (d) 5% CO2.\n",
      "Hence, the optimum charging method of the cell, i.e. CO2 capture, is to operate at a constant potential just larger than the first potential window Î”V1. The greater the charging voltage, the faster the reduction reaction due to the larger overpotential. For practical reasons, and to avoid large current surges, the cell can be charged at a constant current until the desired charging potential difference is reached. This will be between Î”V1 and Î”V2 based on the rate of charging desired. At this point the bed is activated for capture by making half the total capture capacity available. Then the cell can be set at that constant potential until saturation of the cathodes is achieved. The second half of the capture capacity is made available as more CO2 flows in.\n",
      "It is also possible to fully activate the bed by charging at a potential difference Î”VHigh > Î”V1, at which point the cells are disconnected and allowed to saturate with no further supply of current, until breakthrough is achieved, and the bed is regenerated by discharging the cell and releasing pure CO2. The energy recovered however, cannot exceed QÎ”V1, resulting in an energy loss of greater than Q(Î”VHigh âˆ’ Î”V1).\n",
      "Model results for flow system.\n",
      "The model described above was also used to simulate the capture of CO2 from a channel under flow conditions. The gas flowed parallel to the electrodes in the cell, a cross-section of which is shown in Fig. 9. The simulated concentration profiles in the channel and the quinone electrode are shown as a function of the number of bed volumes in Fig. 11(a). The gas phase profiles are consistent with a dispersed plug flow in the channels, with a reasonably sharp adsorption front, while the linear CO2 profiles in the electrode are a result of the significant diffusional limitations in this region. Of particular interest is the depletion of unbound quinonic species in the cathode as removal of CO2 from the channel proceeds; as the cathode becomes saturated with CO2, the concentration of CO2 increases along the length of the channel until breakthrough is achieved at around 8 bed volumes, after which further saturation is allowed until the outlet concentration is equal to the inlet concentration at around 10 bed volumes. Fig. 11(b) and (c) show the breakthrough profiles as a function of cell voltage for a given feed concentration, and of feed concentration for a given cell voltage, respectively. The number of bed volumes required increases with decreasing feed concentrations, a result of the fixed overall bed capacity and the rectangular nature of the adsorption isotherm of this system. In the absence of transport and reaction limitations, all breakthrough curves should collapse when the bed volume is multiplied by the feed fraction of the adsorbate; the fact that this is not exactly so in Fig. 11(d) indicates that mass transfer limitations do play a role in the uptake of CO2 by the activated electrodes. Nevertheless, the overall capacity, indicated by the trapezoidal area under Cout/Cin = 1 and the breakthrough curves, remained constant. However, the effect of a stronger driving force on improved mass transfer is evident in Fig. 11(b), where at charging potentials that are closer to Î”V2, more of the dianion is generated in a Nernstian distribution, which provides two reaction sites for CO2. This results in a stronger driving force in the adsorption of CO2 and hence improved mass transfer, which yields a sharper breakthrough profile.\n",

(d) Normalized breakthrough profiles of the capture experiments in (c). (e) The current across the electrochemical cells during the capture experiments in (b). (f) The current across the electrochemical cells during the capture experiments in (c).\n",
      "Fig. 11(e) and (f) show the current across the electrochemical cell during the capture experiments in (c) and (b) respectively. Fig. 11(e) shows that at low potential charging, i.e. 1.3 V, an initial spike in current is observed which results from the reduction of the quinones on the electrodes to semiquinone, as explained earlier. This is followed by a region of constant current which is proportional to the flux of CO2 into the electrodes, since it reacts with the semiquinones and allows them to accept a second electron at the low potential. As the electrodes become saturated and all the semiquinone is depleted, the current decreases. This region of constant current followed by the sharp decrease is very broad for the 10% case, but much shorter for the 50% case, where there is a brief transition from the initial spike to the decreasing current region manifested in a shoulder. However, Fig. 11(f) shows that as the applied capture potential increases, the current profile for the same inlet concentration changes dramatically. This is elucidated in Scheme 3; as the applied potential approaches Î”V2, all of the quinone is reduced to semiquinone and a Nernstian distribution of semiquinone and quinol dianion is generated, evident by the increasing current in the first peak.\n",
      "Scheme 3\n",
      "The reduction of anthraquinone at a potential higher than its second reduction potential with a limited flux of CO2.\n",
      "Thus, CO2 reacts with the Nernstian mixture of semiquinone and quinol dianion, where in the case of the latter no further reaction, chemical or electrochemical, occurs, but in the case of the former a semiquinone monoadduct species is formed, which can be reduced to the dianion monoadduct at Î”V1. Therefore, the applied potential presents a large overpotential for this reaction, hence the second increase in the current which corresponds to the electron transfer for this reduction. Following these steps, all the quinone moieties in the electrodes are in their doubly charged states and no further electron transfer occurs. This double peak behavior of the current is the result of the balance between the rate of electron transfer and the flux of CO2, which relates to the earlier discussions. At charging potentials higher than Î”V2e.g. Î”VHigh, not shown here, a larger first peak is expected where all the quinone is converted to semiquinone then dianion, i.e. two consecutive single-electron reductions, after which the current drops to zero and only chemical addition reactions occur, Scheme 2(b).\n",
      "Energetic analysis of CO2 release\n",
      "The applied release potential determines the energy recovered from the cell upon the release of CO2, and must, therefore, be selected carefully. While quinones under N2 are expected to be reduced and oxidized reversibly without any significant loss of energy, in an electrophile-rich environment, such as CO2, the reduction is only quasi-reversible due to the energetic penalty of breaking a bond formed with CO2. Therefore, some of the energy is lost in the process, and it is imperative to minimize this loss, since it is directly related to energy per mole of CO2 concentrated (captured and released) in a CO2 capture process. The last step in the CO2 capture, Scheme 1(b), i.e. the addition of a second molecule of CO2 to the semiquinone monoadduct to form a dianion diadduct, is chemically irreversible for the duration of the cycle,37 and the release reaction takes place via an electrochemical oxidation of the diadduct. This oxidation occurs at a more positive potential than the first reduction potential E01. Thus, the more positive the release potential, the larger the overpotential and the faster and more complete is the release of the bound CO2. However, a more positive release voltage corresponds to less energy recovered during discharge, and thus more work done per cycle of capture and release, which is given by eqn (2).\n",
      "Consequently, to reduce energy losses per cycle, a less positive potential can be used in a constant potential discharge. While the capture cell voltage can be maintained at fairly minimal levels by setting it close to Î”V1, with some diminishment in rate, release at high cell voltages can result in a partial release of CO2, due to the partial oxidation of the bis(carbonate) quinone units (dianion diadduct units), and a subsequent underutilization of anthraquinone. After a few cycles of capture and release at a higher potential, a constant equilibrium rate of utilization of anthraquinone is achieved. This is akin to the working capacity of a pressure-swing adsorption system.45 Thus partial release can be achieved at higher cell discharge potentials as shown in Fig. 12. This allows for a much smaller window of operation, which at the âˆ¼90% faradaic efficiency reported earlier, an energy use of âˆ¼43 kJ molâˆ’1, with 60% utilization of accessible quinone is possible. This is on par with other carbon capture systems in efficiency and energy consumption,46,47 including thermal swing systems.48\n",
      "Fig. 12\n",
      "Fraction of CO2 released from the PAQâ€“CNT electrode with release voltage. At a constant capture cell voltage of 1.3 V, less of the bed is recovered with increasing release cell voltage, but the energy per mole of CO2 captured and released also decreases.\n",
      "Solid sorbent materials used in carbon capture applications have enthalpies of CO2 adsorption of the same order, e.g., Metalâ€“Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with 30â€“50 kJ molâˆ’1 for some types of MOF-74,49 and âˆ¼100 kJ molâˆ’1 for some amine functionalized MOFs,50 or zeolites, such as 13X at 40 kJ molâˆ’1.51 However, these are not process energetics but rather enthalpies of adsorption. Therefore, processes which are designed to utilize these materials incur greater energetic penalties associated with the techniques used for delivering the energy for desorption, i.e. heat and pressure change, whereas the energetics reported herein correspond to that of the process, which unlike those utilizing solid sorbents, has a binary affinity for CO2.\n",
      "Moreover, if a precise rate of release is desired, the cell can be discharged at a constant current. In this case, the flux of the released CO2 is proportional to the current density, as given by eqn (3). The discharge current and time, control the charge transferred, which is the extensive variable in the work of the process. This method of release is seldom utilized in swing adsorption processes, because it is the intensive, rather than the extensive variable, that is modulated, e.g., temperature in thermal swing, pressure in pressure swing, and, here, potential. Nevertheless, this can be useful for fast regeneration of the bed at high currents, where long periods of capture and short periods of release are desired. But due to the incomplete discharge of the electrochemical cells, in analogy with high current discharge of batteries,30 the bed will only be partially regenerated.\n",
      "Swing operations\n",
      "The electro-swing adsorption (ESA) technology developed in this work has a number of perceived advantages over other swing technologies such as temperature- (TSA) and pressure-swing (PSA) adsorption in terms of both its mode of operation and its thermodynamic adsorption characteristics, as illustrated in Fig. 13. Temperature-swing operations require heating and cooling of the entire adsorption matrix to release the adsorbed compounds, rather than just targeting the adsorption sites themselves, which introduces many thermal inefficiencies to the operation. The heating is typically accomplished with high-temperature steam as the sweep gas, with subsequent condensation of the steam to recover the pure CO2 product stream, whereas cooling is achieved during the blowdown phase in preparation for the next sorption cycle. With pressure-swing operations, the release of the captured material occurs on reduction of the adsorbate partial pressure in the sweep to reverse the mass transfer driving force, which can be achieved either by drawing a vacuum on the bed, or by using low pressure steam as the sweep gas. The product leaving the bed is dilute, and requires a second separation step, such as the condensation of steam, and external compression of the resulting CO2 to bring it to the desired pressures for subsequent utilization or for transportation and subsurface sequestration in geologic formations. Moreover, in both TSA and PSA operations, the working capacity is strongly dependent on the shape of the Langmuir- (or Freundlich-) type isotherm, with significantly lower capacities at lower concentrations, which limits the degree of regeneration of the adsorbent, or the partial pressure of the recovered adsorbate in the sweep stream. The electro-swing adsorbents, on the other hand, are characterized by a rectangular adsorption isotherm in which the saturation loading capacity in the activated state is independent of the gas phase concentration, so the adsorbent is equally effective over a wide range of feed concentrations from ambient conditions through to those characteristic of large scale power and industrial facilities. When deactivated, the adsorbent has negligible capacity for the CO2 even at high CO2 gas phase concentrations such that the working capacity of the adsorbent is independent of operating conditions. Thus, the sweep stream during the desorption process can be pure CO2 at the desired pressure, subject primarily to equipment design constraints, which greatly simplifies the adsorption/desorption cycle relative to those of the TSA and PSA processes. The results in Fig. 6(a) show that release into a pure CO2 gas environment is facile and fast, and complete if sufficient time is allowed to account for the kinetics of the process.\n",

      "Conclusions\n",
      "The electro-swing operations outlined in this paper offer a new approach to the exploitation of electrochemically mediated complexation of CO2 with redox-active species for the mitigation of CO2 emissions, and for control of CO2 levels in confined environments. Electro-swing adsorption has been shown to be equally effective, at a constant capacity, for the capture of CO2 at concentrations typical of fossil fuel combustion flue gases (âˆ¼10%) and in confined ambient environments (0.6â€“0.8%). These advances have been made possible by the development of new electrode materials in which redox-active moieties, such as quinones, that can bind CO2 in one oxidation state but not in another are immobilized onto the electrode substrates. These functionalized electrodes were incorporated into an electrochemical cell assembly to facilitate their cyclical electrochemical reduction and oxidation. The cells demonstrated exceptional capture and release of CO2 over more than 7000 cycles at 60â€“70% quinone utilization, 90% faradaic efficiency, and 90 kJ molâˆ’1 at 100% bed utilization and 43 kJ molâˆ’1 at 60%. A significant advantage of the quinone-functionalized electrodes is that they have a CO2 capacity that is essentially independent of the inlet feed concentration, in contrast to the capacities of sorbents typically used in PSA or TSA operations, where Langmuir-type equilibria limit capacity at lower concentrations.\n",
      "The strong performance of the electro-swing process allows for numerous applications where CO2 removal and/or storage is of interest. The ESA device can be easily integrated into processes in a plug-and-play fashion due to its simple design, and minimum requirement for ancillary equipment, primarily a regulated power source and sink (load). An initial techno-economic analysis (not reported here) shows that such carbon capture systems can be economically feasible with costs ranging from $50â€“$100 per tonne CO2 depending on the feed concentrations and applications under consideration.\n",
      "It is projected that further optimization of the ESA process can be obtained through refinement of the electrode chemistries and their assembly into compact adsorption devices to address a wide range of CO2 mitigation strategies.\n",

      "Carbon capture is one of the foremost methods for curtailing greenhouse gas emissions. Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\n",

      "Below include all the problems to prioritize:\n",
      "Prioritized list of problems based on biggest bottleneck to increasing the approach's carbon capture efficiency:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Mass transfer limitations: The transport of CO2 into the porous electrode is the rate-limiting step in the carbon capture process. This can result in slower capture rates and broader breakthrough profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Variation in channel width: Imperfect packing of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to variation in channel width, causing uneven distribution of flow and overlapping breakthrough profiles.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. Electrode degradation: Over time, the electrochemical cells may experience degradation, resulting in a loss of capacity. This can be due to electromigration of shorter polymer chains from the electrode and into the electrolyte.\n",

      "5. Energy requirements: The energy required for the capture and release of CO2 can vary depending on the flux of CO2 and the rate of reduction of the quinones. Lower CO2 fluxes can result in higher energy requirements.\n",

      "6. Channeling effects: Improper assembly of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to channeling, where some channels bypass the active cells. This can result in lower overall efficiency and incomplete capture of CO2.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Sensitivity to oxygen: The presence of oxygen in the feed stream can cause oxidation of the reduced quinones, reducing the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system. Careful tuning of the electron density of the quinone polymer is required to avoid reactions with oxygen.\n",

      "1. Mass transfer limitations: The transport of CO2 into the porous electrode is the rate-limiting step in the carbon capture process. This can result in slower capture rates and broader breakthrough profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Variation in channel width: Imperfect packing of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to variation in channel width, causing uneven distribution of flow and overlapping breakthrough profiles.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. Electrode degradation: Over time, the electrochemical cells may experience degradation, resulting in a loss of capacity. This can be due to electromigration of shorter polymer chains from the electrode and into the electrolyte.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Energy requirements: The energy required for the capture and release of CO2 can vary depending on the flux of CO2 and the rate of reduction of the quinones. Lower CO2 fluxes can result in higher energy requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Channeling effects: Improper assembly of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to channeling, where some channels bypass the active cells. This can result in lower overall efficiency and incomplete capture of CO2.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Sensitivity to oxygen: The presence of oxygen in the feed stream can cause oxidation of the reduced quinones, reducing the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system. Careful tuning of the electron density of the quinone polymer is required to avoid reactions with oxygen.\n",

      "8. Complex flow systems: The electrochemical cell system eliminates the need for complex flow systems, but the assembly and design of the contactor bed can still be challenging and require careful optimization.\n",

Energy losses during release: The release of CO2 from the system incurs energy losses due to the quasi-reversible nature of the reduction reaction in an electrophile-rich environment like CO2.

      "18. Energy consumption: The reported energy use for the system ranges from 43 to 90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, depending on the bed utilization and release potential. While this is on par with other carbon capture systems, further optimization is needed to reduce energy consumption and make the system more efficient.\n",

    "Carbon capture is one of the foremost methods for curtailing greenhouse gas emissions. Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\n",

      "['1. Mass transfer limitations: The transport of CO2 into the porous electrode is the rate-limiting step in the carbon capture process. This can result in slower capture rates and broader breakthrough profiles.', '2. Variation in channel width: Imperfect packing of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to variation in channel width, causing uneven distribution of flow and overlapping breakthrough profiles.', '3. Sluggish electron transfer: The CVs of the polyanthraquinone-carbon nanotube (PAQ-CNT) composite electrodes show sluggish electron transfer, which can affect the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system.', '4. Electrode degradation: Over time, the electrochemical cells may experience degradation, resulting in a loss of capacity. This can be due to electromigration of shorter polymer chains from the electrode and into the electrolyte.', '5. Energy requirements: The energy required for the capture and release of CO2 can vary depending on the flux of CO2 and the rate of reduction of the quinones. Lower CO2 fluxes can result in higher energy requirements.', '6. Channeling effects: Improper assembly of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to channeling, where some channels bypass the active cells. This can result in lower overall efficiency and incomplete capture of CO2.', '7. Sensitivity to oxygen: The presence of oxygen in the feed stream can cause oxidation of the reduced quinones, reducing the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system. Careful tuning of the electron density of the quinone polymer is required to avoid reactions with oxygen.', '8. Complex flow systems: The electrochemical cell system eliminates the need for complex flow systems, but the assembly and design of the contactor bed can still be challenging and require careful optimization.', '9. Limited capacity: The capacity of the electrochemical cells and contactor bed is limited by the amount of quinone material and the overall size of the system. Scaling up the system may require additional optimization and engineering considerations.', '10. Limited applicability: The electrochemical cell system may not be suitable for all carbon capture applications, as it is primarily designed for capturing CO2 from flue gas and other CO2-rich streams. Other carbon capture scenarios, such as removing CO2 from enclosed spaces or low concentration streams, may require different approaches.', '11. Limited capacity: The system has a limited capacity for CO2 capture, as indicated by the rectangular adsorption isotherm. This limits the degree of regeneration of the adsorbent and the partial pressure of the recovered CO2 in the sweep stream.', '12. Mass transfer limitations: The system may experience mass transfer limitations, as indicated by the breakthrough profiles in flow system experiments. This can affect the uptake of CO2 by the activated electrodes.', '13. Energy losses during release: The release of CO2 from the system incurs energy losses due to the quasi-reversible nature of the reduction reaction in an electrophile-rich environment like CO2. The more positive the release potential, the larger the overpotential and the faster the release, but the less energy is recovered during discharge.', '14. Partial release at high discharge potentials: High discharge potentials can result in partial release of CO2 due to the partial oxidation of the bis(carbonate) quinone units. This can lead to underutilization of anthraquinone and incomplete regeneration of the adsorption bed.', '15. Complex electrode chemistries: The electrode materials used in the system, such as poly(1,4-anthraquinone) and poly(vinylferrocene), may have complex synthesis and preparation processes, which can add complexity to the overall system.', '16. Limited faradaic efficiency: Although the system demonstrates a faradaic efficiency of >90%, there is still room for improvement in terms of increasing the efficiency of the electrochemical reactions involved in CO2 capture and release.', '17. Durability concerns: The durability of the electrochemical cells used in the system is reported to show <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cycles. While this is promising, further studies are needed to assess the long-term durability and stability of the cells under various operating conditions.', '18. Energy consumption: The reported energy use for the system ranges from 43 to 90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, depending on the bed utilization and release potential. While this is on par with other carbon capture systems, further optimization is needed to reduce energy consumption and make the system more efficient.', '19. Techno-economic feasibility: While an initial techno-economic analysis suggests that the carbon capture system can be economically feasible with costs ranging from $50-$100 per tonne of CO2, further analysis and optimization are needed to assess the economic viability of the system for different applications and feed concentrations.']\n"

Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\n",

The electrode substrate was dip-coated in the ink and dried slowly to yield a composite that uniformly coated the substrate at ∼1.4 mg cm−2, as shown in Fig. 4. The CVs of the PVFc–CNT electrode in N2 and CO2 saturated [Bmim][TF2N] are identical, and are indicated by the blue line in Fig. 3. PVFc–CNT has a reduction potential of E0 = −0.03 V, against ferrocene (Fc).\n",

      "The electrochemical cell.\n",
      "The PAQ–CNT electrodes were assembled into an electrochemical cell in which CO2 was able to be captured and released upon potential swings. This was accomplished by layering a PVFc–CNT counter electrode between the two PAQ–CNT electrodes to balance the charge of these electrodes, as shown in Fig. 5(d). In a CO2-rich environment, this afforded a polymer-based battery with an electrochemical window of ∼1.2 V, where all the charge from the ferrocene oxidation, at its reduction potential, was balanced by the charge transferred to the two-electron reduction of quinone, at its first reduction potential. This window is defined by the reduction potential of PVFc–CNT and the first reduction potential of PAQ–CNT, shown in Fig. 3 as ΔV1. However, in the absence of CO2 or other such electrophiles, mainly under N2, PAQ retains its two one-electron reductions, with half of the charge of the ferrocene oxidation being balanced by the reduction of quinone at the first potential and the other half by its reduction at the second potential. This results in a wider electrochemical window, shown in Fig. 3 as ΔV2, and the behavior of the cell resembles that of an asymmetric pseudocapacitor.35\n",

      "The capacities of the anode and cathodes of the cell, evaluated by gravimetric charge calibration of the two electrode composite materials (Fig. S5, ESI†), were balanced by requiring that mP14AQ–CNT = 1.12mPFVc–CNT, which allowed for some excess PVFc–CNT.\n",
      "Carbon capture\n",
      "Two different types of units were fabricated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the electro-swing process. The first was a sealed chamber into which the electrodes were inserted. Changes in pressure were measured as CO2 was adsorbed and then released on cycling of the potential applied to the electrodes. The second approach used a flow adsorption in which the CO2 exiting the device was monitored, with the breakthrough point reflecting the overall capacity of the electrodes. All carbon capture experiments were conducted at T ∼ 21 °C.\n",

      "The chronoamperometric experiments performed in the sealed system were repeated in a flow system. Mixtures of N2 and CO2 at different compositions were flown past the stack of assembled electrochemical cells. Upon reduction of the PAQ–CNT electrodes, CO2 was removed (captured) from the inlet stream, and the decrease in the concentration of CO2 was detected at the outlet stream. In these experiments the bed was fully activated by charging at a constant potential greater than ΔV22 to guarantee the complete reduction of the all accessible quinone units prior to adsorption. Experiments with an initial half activation, i.e., at ΔV1, followed by adsorption at constant potential, did not result in different breakthrough curves, mainly because the kinetics of the reduction and the adsorption reactions are much faster than the rates of mass transfer of CO2 into the film, as discussed later.\n",
      "The breakthrough profiles obtained for one flow system are shown in Fig. 8(a). Breakthrough was achieved at smaller bed volumes of gas treated for higher feed CO2 concentrations, where the bed volume is a time measure which represents the total volume of gas treated at any given time relative to the volume of the bed itself. The breakthrough curves superimpose when normalized by the inlet CO2 concentration, shown in Fig. 8(b), which indicates a consistent behavior of the bed, i.e. equal utilization of the overall adsorption capacity regardless of the inlet concentration, an indication of a rectangular equilibrium isotherm. Note in this particular module that, although the breakthrough curves themselves were sharp, prior to breakthrough there was a consistent effluent concentration of 20% of the feed concentration, the result of a bypassing of the active cells by 20% of the total gas flow. The overall capacity of the bed can be calculated from the area between the line at Cout/Cin = 1 and the normalized breakthrough curve. A contactor bed of a desired overall capacity can be designed by linear scaling from this overall capacity.

A number of different cells were constructed in the flow bed configuration shown in Fig. 7(b). The exposed area of a typical cell was 18 cm × 10 cm, with ∼0.2 g of P14AQ–CNT composite; at ∼70% useful quinones, this amounted to the adsorption of ∼9–14 cm3 of CO2. The channels between the cells were typically ∼500 μm thick, and bed volumes were about 35 cm3 with a total bed weight of ∼1.5 g bringing the productivity of the bed to 0.01–0.02 kg CO2 per kgbedtb, where tb is the breakthrough time, i.e. the time to reach saturation of the electrodes or for the outlet CO2 concentration to begin to increase.

      "The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the PAQ–CNT composite on the electrode substrate in [Bmim][TF2N] saturated with N2, the green line in Fig. 3, shows two redox couples corresponding to the two reduction potentials of anthraquinone. The cathodic and anodic peaks, however, are broader than those reported for solutions of quinone molecules in electrolytes,20 which can be ascribed to the slower electron exchange between differently-reduced redox units, i.e. neutral quinone, semiquinone (radical anion) and quinol dianion, along the π-conjugated backbone of the polymer,43 and also to the diffusion and electromigration of electrolytic species into and out of the porous PAQ–CNT film.44 The expected disappearance of the second redox couple of the CV under CO2 was observed, as shown by the red line in Fig. 3, and attributed to the carboxylation of the reduced quinone units along the polymer chain facilitating the second electron reduction of anthraquinone at the first reduction potential, with the consequent increase in the current at that potential. The PAQ–CNT electrode can therefore be used to remove CO2 selectively from a gas mixture via nucleophilic addition, and regenerated via an electrochemical oxidation, with release of the CO2, as shown earlier. The two reduction potentials under N2 are E01 = −1.21 V and E02 = −1.63 V, vs. Fc. Under CO2 these two potentials coalesce to yield a single quasi-reversible redox couple at the first reduction potential observed under N2, i.e. E01.\n",
      "The separation of the oxidation and reduction peaks in the CVs reported is large, indicating sluggish electron transfer to the quinone repeat units on the polymer, and a thick diffusion layer in the porous electrode.44 While the ratio of polymer to CNT was optimized for the greatest gravimetric capacity, it is not the ideal ratio for conductivity. Some of the conductivity takes place through the backbone of the polymer, which contributes to the slow electron transfer. This, however, does not present a problem in the design of the contactor separation unit, since the rate limiting step in the CO2 capture process is the transport of CO2 and not electron transfer.\n",

      "CO2 deprivation was not a problem in the highly saturated electrolyte in the CV electrochemical characterizations, where the concentration of CO2 in the electrolyte was about 20 times higher than that of the quinones on the electrode. However, in an adsorption system, where the electrolyte is not saturated with CO2 there needs to be a careful balance between the advective and diffusive fluxes of CO2 towards the anthraquinone cathodes for reductive addition, and the rate of the reduction of anthraquinone. This can be better controlled by charging the cell, i.e. reducing the anthraquinone, at a constant potential that is sufficient to drive the first reduction of anthraquinone but not the second, i.e. charging the cell at a potential difference that is between ΔV1 and ΔV2. With operation at this constant potential, the flux of CO2 does not affect the energy of binding, since the second electron is acquired by a semiquinone at the first reduction potential, but only after the first CO2 addition occurs; following this second reduction, a second CO2 molecule can bind to the dianion monoadduct. When the first reduction is allowed in a CO2-lean environment at a constant potential, the current observed after the initial surge, which results from the first reduction, is proportional to the flux of CO2 towards the anthraquinone electrode. Nevertheless, this current ultimately diminishes due to the decrease in the number of semiquinones available to react with CO2. In a CO2-rich environment, at constant potential charging, the observed current after the initial surge is proportional to the transport of CO2 into the electrode and the rate of the addition reaction which follows the nucleophilic addition mechanism between semiquinones and dissolved CO2, R = kCQ˙−CCO2,IL(4)where R is the rate of the reaction and k is the rate constant. The electrochemical steps proceed at a faster rate than the chemical reactions, but both types of reactions have rates that are faster than the rate of diffusion of CO2 in the IL, leading to a large Damköhler number, (5)where CQ is the initial concentration of anthraquinone repeat units on the electrode, CCO2 is the concentration of CO2 in the IL, L is the thickness of the IL-wetted porous electrode, which is about 150 μm, and DCO2,IL is the diffusion coefficient of CO2 in the IL and is about 4 × 10−10 m2 s−1. While it is the semiquinone that participates in the reaction here, the initial concentration CQ is a good approximation for estimating the order of magnitude of Da. The rate constant can be estimated to be 102 M−1 s−1,37 resulting in Da ∼104. Large values of Da indicate that mass transfer will control the process and thus the charging and subsequent carboxylation of the quinones can be assumed to be in equilibrium with the prevailing CO2 concentration at any position and at any time.

In the sealed system, the partial pressure of the gas decreases during capture, while in flow the CO2 concentration changes along the gas channel with time, and the concentration of the gas leaving the device is a measure of the total effectiveness of the adsorption bed capacity and transport and kinetic limitations within the system. The total transport of CO2 is modelled by transport equations in each of the two phases, gas and IL. In the gas phase, the mass transfer governing equation in the sealed system is given by (13)where CCO2,gas is the concentration of CO2 in the gas phase, obtained from its partial pressure and the ideal gas law.

      "The simulation of constant-current charging at 0–5% CO2 concentrations in the sealed system in which the gas channel shown in Fig. 9 served as a gas headspace, shows results that are consistent with the aforementioned mechanism of CO2 capture. In addition to the cell voltage, the concentrations of all the cathode quinonic species were studied during the charging process. Fig. 10 shows the cell voltages at 0–5% CO2 and the concentration profiles of cathode species at 0, 2, and 5% CO2. The cell voltage profiles in Fig. 10(a) show that as the concentration of CO2 increases, less of the cell charging occurs at the higher potential. At 0% CO2 the cell simply traverses both reduction potentials of the quinone, and the species profiles in Fig. 10(b) show two consecutive conversions; the first is the reduction of quinone to semiquinone, and the second is the reduction of semiquinone to quinol dianion. The second reaction starts only after all the quinone is converted to semiquinone, and to further accommodate the incoming electrons at the constant current, the second, more energetic reduction takes place until all faradaic reactions are exhausted. Here, the simulation was stopped just short of full conversion to avoid numerical complications that arise from the exhaustion of faradaic material, i.e. complete charging. At 2% CO2, upon generation of the semiquinone, shown in Fig. 10(c), the modest diffusive flux of CO2 allows for the formation of the semiquinone monoadduct which soon accepts a second electron at the first reduction potential of quinone, hence extending the cell charging period spent at the lower potential. This dianion monoadduct can then react with a second CO2 molecule, to form the dianion diadduct. But, upon the depletion of CO2 in the vicinity of the cathode, due to a charging rate that is faster than the diffusive flux of CO2 into the electrolyte at 2% headspace concentration, the semiquinone is converted to the dianion at the higher second potential, while the concentrations of the dianion monoadduct and the dianion diadduct remain constant. This is reflected in the potential profile at 2% CO2 in Fig. 10(a). However, at 5% CO2, the diffusive flux of CO2 is adequate, and barely any semiquinone can be detected since it is converted to semiquinone monoadduct, and other subsequent species, soon after generation, shown in Fig. 10(d). Here, all the electrochemical reactions take place at the first potential and none of the semiquinone is converted to quinol dianion.\n",

The gas flowed parallel to the electrodes in the cell, a cross-section of which is shown in Fig. 9. The simulated concentration profiles in the channel and the quinone electrode are shown as a function of the number of bed volumes in Fig. 11(a). The gas phase profiles are consistent with a dispersed plug flow in the channels, with a reasonably sharp adsorption front, while the linear CO2 profiles in the electrode are a result of the significant diffusional limitations in this region. Of particular interest is the depletion of unbound quinonic species in the cathode as removal of CO2 from the channel proceeds; as the cathode becomes saturated with CO2, the concentration of CO2 increases along the length of the channel until breakthrough is achieved at around 8 bed volumes, after which further saturation is allowed until the outlet concentration is equal to the inlet concentration at around 10 bed volumes.

      "The electro-swing operations outlined in this paper offer a new approach to the exploitation of electrochemically mediated complexation of CO2 with redox-active species for the mitigation of CO2 emissions, and for control of CO2 levels in confined environments. Electro-swing adsorption has been shown to be equally effective, at a constant capacity, for the capture of CO2 at concentrations typical of fossil fuel combustion flue gases (∼10%) and in confined ambient environments (0.6–0.8%). These advances have been made possible by the development of new electrode materials in which redox-active moieties, such as quinones, that can bind CO2 in one oxidation state but not in another are immobilized onto the electrode substrates. These functionalized electrodes were incorporated into an electrochemical cell assembly to facilitate their cyclical electrochemical reduction and oxidation. The cells demonstrated exceptional capture and release of CO2 over more than 7000 cycles at 60–70% quinone utilization, 90% faradaic efficiency, and 90 kJ mol−1 at 100% bed utilization and 43 kJ mol−1 at 60%. A significant advantage of the quinone-functionalized electrodes is that they have a CO2 capacity that is essentially independent of the inlet feed concentration, in contrast to the capacities of sorbents typically used in PSA or TSA operations, where Langmuir-type equilibria limit capacity at lower concentrations.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Electrode Assembly: The assembly of the functionalized electrodes into compact adsorption devices needs to be refined. This is necessary to ensure efficient and effective CO2 capture and release, as well as to enable the integration of the ESA device into various CO2 mitigation strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Quinone Utilization: The ESA process relies on the utilization of quinone-functionalized electrodes. To maximize the efficiency of the process, it is important to achieve high quinone utilization rates. Currently, the ESA process demonstrates 60-70% quinone utilization, and further improvements are desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Faradaic Efficiency: The faradaic efficiency of the ESA process is reported to be 90%. While this is a high value, there is still room for improvement to enhance the overall energy efficiency of the carbon capture system.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Kinetics: The release of CO2 into a pure CO2 gas environment is described as facile and fast, but it requires sufficient time to account for the kinetics of the process. The kinetics of the ESA process should be carefully considered and optimized to ensure efficient CO2 capture and release.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Feed Concentration Dependency: The quinone-functionalized electrodes used in the ESA process have a CO2 capacity that is essentially independent of the inlet feed concentration. However, it is important to ensure that the ESA process remains effective for a wide range of feed concentrations, including both typical flue gas concentrations (∼10%) and confined ambient environments (0.6–0.8%).\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Techno-Economic Analysis: While an initial techno-economic analysis suggests that the ESA carbon capture systems can be economically feasible, further analysis and consideration of various feed concentrations and applications are required to determine the actual costs, which can range from $50–$100 per tonne of CO2.\n",

Potential difference was applied across the power feed-throughs that were connected to the electrochemical cells, and the decrease and increase in pressure in the chamber, upon capture and release, respectively, was monitored using a Omega® PXM409-USBH pressure transducer with a range of 0–15 psia and an accuracy of 0.08% BSL.\n",

The stack of these cells, separated by ∼500 μm, was placed in a gas flow chamber (the experimental setup) and gas was flown past them. Mixtures of nitrogen and carbon dioxide at ∼10 mL min−1 and various inlet concentrations of CO2 at T ∼ 21 °C were studied. The bed volume of the system was 70 cm3.

      "FIVE WHYS TO UNDERSTAND AN APPROACH'S MAIN FINDINGS: \n",
      " 1. Why was the research conducted?\n",
      "The research was conducted to find solutions for the environmental problem of increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, which causes climate change and global warming. The goal was to explore negative emissions technologies, specifically direct air capture (DAC), as a means to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and potentially achieve net negative global emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Why is DAC considered an important technology?\n",
      "DAC is considered important because it offers several advantages. It is independent of CO2 source location, as CO2 is distributed homogeneously throughout the atmosphere. It can tackle emissions from the transport sector and other small sources. DAC is also versatile and can be used for long-term storage and sequestration of CO2 (DACCS) or for short-term utilization in chemical processes (DACCU). Additionally, DAC contributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals and does not require arable land.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Why are absorption and adsorption technologies the most studied in DAC?\n",
      "Absorption and adsorption technologies are the most studied in DAC because they are mature and well-established technologies. They have been extensively analyzed in the literature and offer promising potential for CO2 capture from the air. These technologies have been used in various applications and industries, making them a focus of research and development in the field of DAC.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Why are thermodynamic issues significant in DAC?\n",
      "Thermodynamic issues are significant in DAC because they determine the minimum amount of energy required for CO2 separation from the air. The dilute nature of CO2 in the atmosphere, with a partial pressure about 350 times lower than coal flue gas, necessitates the processing of large volumes of air to capture a significant amount of CO2. This results in high energy and cost requirements for DAC systems. Understanding and addressing these thermodynamic challenges is crucial for improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of DAC technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Why is reducing costs and improving efficiency important for large-scale DAC deployment?\n",
      "Reducing costs and improving efficiency are important for large-scale DAC deployment because they are key factors in making the technology economically viable and scalable. Lowering the cost of DAC systems would make them more accessible and attractive for widespread implementation. Improving efficiency would reduce the energy requirements and associated costs, making DAC more sustainable and economically feasible. These efforts are necessary to accelerate the development and deployment of DAC at a large scale to achieve significant CO2 reduction and negative emissions.\n",

      "1. Direct air capture (DAC) technologies, particularly absorption and adsorption, have been extensively studied and show promise for CO2 capture from the atmosphere.\n",
      "2. DAC offers advantages such as independence from CO2 source location, versatility for long-term storage or short-term utilization, and potential to address emissions from small sources.\n",
      "3. Thermodynamic challenges, including the low concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, result in high energy requirements and costs for DAC systems.\n",
      "4. Reducing costs and improving efficiency are crucial for large-scale DAC deployment to make the technology economically viable and scalable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenges:\n",
      "1. High energy requirements and associated costs due to the dilute nature of CO2 in the atmosphere.\n",
      "2. Technological advancements needed to enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of DAC systems.\n",
      "3. Scaling up DAC to achieve significant CO2 reduction and negative emissions poses logistical and infrastructure challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noteworthy:\n",
      "1. DAC technologies have the potential to contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goals and do not require arable land.\n",
      "2. DAC can address emissions from the transport sector and other small sources, complementing other carbon capture and storage (CCS) approaches.\n",
      "3. Absorption and adsorption technologies have been the most studied in DAC due to their maturity and established track record in various applications and industries.\n",

In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\n",

We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\n",

      " 1. Why is the proposed carbon capture system more efficient than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured?\n",
      "The proposed carbon capture system is more efficient than SOTA systems because it utilizes electrochemical carbon-capture technology, which has high energy efficiency, decentralized operation, and the ability to use renewable electricity. It achieves high carbon-capture rates, high Faradaic efficiencies, high carbon-removal efficiency, and low energy consumption. These factors contribute to its overall higher efficiency in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Why does the proposed system use electrochemical carbon-capture technology?\n",
      "The proposed system uses electrochemical carbon-capture technology because it offers several advantages over other methods. It has high energy efficiency, decentralized operation, and the ability to use renewable electricity. It also avoids the need for chemical inputs or side products, simplifying the carbon absorption/release process. These advantages make electrochemical carbon-capture technology a promising alternative for efficient carbon capture.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Why is the proposed system able to achieve high carbon-capture rates and efficiencies?\n",
      "The proposed system achieves high carbon-capture rates and efficiencies due to its design and operation. It couples oxygen/water redox reactions with a modular solid-electrolyte reactor, allowing for efficient absorption of dilute CO2 molecules and continuous output of a high-purity CO2 stream. The system operates under large current densities, enabling fast CO2 capture while maintaining high Faradaic efficiencies. The triple-phase boundary created at the cathode allows for rapid diffusion of CO2, further enhancing capture rates and efficiencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Why is the proposed system considered scalable and adaptable?\n",
      "The proposed system is considered scalable and adaptable because it can be easily integrated with past advancements in fuel cells and water-splitting catalysts. These advancements provide high energy efficiencies and enable easy scalability. Additionally, the system's modular design and continuous operation make it suitable for various on-site applications, allowing for scalability and adaptability to different CO2 sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Why is the proposed system significant for carbon management and global CO2 emissions?\n",
      "The proposed system is significant for carbon management and global CO2 emissions because it offers a more efficient and practical solution for capturing CO2 from dilute sources, ranging from industrial waste gas to the atmosphere.

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone–hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35 nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, comparable to 530 mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90 mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications.

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone–hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35 nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, comparable to 530 mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90 mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications.

Introduction\\nRecent estimates report that CO 2emissions in the world were more than 33 Gton in\\n2018 [ 1]. In order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, several international agreements\\nwere signed: the Conference of the Parties (COP21) held at Paris on the 12 December 2015\\nwas a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\\n2/1.5\\x0eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was conﬁrmed\\nby the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\\nnational determined contribution (NDC) was deﬁned [ 3]. However, in order to achieve this\\nobjective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\\nnot enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\\nFor this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\\nremoval (CDR) technologies, will have a crucial role in the coming years to achieve the\\nCO 2level deﬁned by the environmental agreements and stabilize the CO 2concentration\\nbetween 350 and 440 ppm [6,7].\\nNegative emissions technologies are deﬁned as the intentional human effort to remove\\nCO 2emissions from the atmosphere and include the following: afforestation and reforesta-\\ntion (AR), soil carbon sequestration (SCS), biochar (BC), bioenergy with carbon capture and\\nstorage (BECCS), direct air capture (DAC), enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization\\n(EW) and ocean fertilization (OF) [ 8]. Among these solutions, the research community has\\nbeen focused for the most part on DAC, due to its advantages [9].\\nDAC was used for decades to produce CO 2-free air to support life in submarines and\\nspacecraft systems [ 10,11]; it was presented by Lackner as a GHG mitigation technology\\nonly in 1999 [ 12]. DAC captures CO 2from the atmosphere to store it as part of a CDR\\nprocess in the long term (direct air carbon capture and storage—DACCS). Integrated\\nDAC systems have also been studied to supply climate-neutral CO 2for chemical processes\\nAppl.

In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\\nTerms & Conditions\\nMost electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone–hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35\\xa0nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520\\xa0mV at a current density of 10\\xa0mA\\xa0cm−2, comparable to 530\\xa0mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90\\xa0mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result.

The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30 percent loss of capacity after 7000 cycles.\n",
