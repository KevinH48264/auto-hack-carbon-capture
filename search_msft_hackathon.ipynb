      "Broader context\n",
      "There is a clear scientific consensus on the role of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the unusually wild fluctuations of global climate patterns over the last century, to which carbon dioxide is the largest contributor. This has generated a scientific tide in the study of carbon removal techniques over the last three decades, which has slowly gathered momentum, culminating in the 2015 Paris Agreement, which heavily emphasized the role of carbon removal by tackling emissions or via negative emissions technologies. While a path forward for carbon capture is being shaped by a mix of incumbent actors and newcomers, the great majority of the proposed processes rely on conventional concepts. Moreover, most of these processes have a large balance of plant which hinders their potential to flexibly adapt to the multi-scale nature of carbon capture. Herein, we demonstrate a new approach which presents a paradigm shift in adsorption type processes and carbon capture. The electro-swing basis of our process allows its linear scaling with desired capacity and lends it geometric flexibility. It also allows carbon capture from streams of any concentration, and its release into any carrier streams, including pure CO2, with a low balance of plant.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "With the alarming increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and its implications for global climate pattern developments,1,2 mitigation of climate change through curtailment of anthropogenic CO2 emissions has been one of the most urgent socioeconomic and scientific problems in the global arena over the last decade.3 To this end, a number of technologies have been developed for the large-scale capture of CO2 from combustion and other industrial processes to produce high-purity CO2 streams for storage or valorization.4 The most mature of these technologies are solvent scrubbing, mainly amine scrubbing,5 and oxyfuel combustion,6 which target high CO2 concentration streams (>10%). These approaches have a large footprint and, when retrofitted to a process, can require major modifications to the plant. Consequently, there has been a major effort to develop new materials and processes for high efficiency CO2-capture, including sorbents for pressure and temperature swing adsorption systems,7 and membranes for selective transport of the CO2.8 Furthermore, many potential applications of carbon capture require compact devices due to space limitations, such as in the direct capture of CO2 from tailpipe exhausts on board mobile sources, in which there is growing interest given the large contribution of transportation exhaust to greenhouse gas emissions (33.5% of U.S. CO2 emissions in 2016).9\n",
      "In addition to the capture of CO2 from direct combustion processes, there is a need to remove CO2 from enclosed spaces for ventilation purposes in buildings and car cabins, or for cabin environmental control systems on board spacecraft and submarines, where the maximum allowed CO2 concentration in habitable spaces is 5000 ppm (or 0.5%).10 The first of such systems was developed by Winnick et al., for the electrochemical capture of CO2 in spacecraft cabins using molten carbonates.11 However, the low concentration of CO2 in such applications poses a challenge, mainly due to the low driving forces for mass transfer and the large quantities of other species present in air in addition to CO2.12 Thus, carbon capture is a multi-scale problem, where the CO2-rich streams to be treated vary greatly in volume, concentration and composition, and different criteria need to be fulfilled to ensure optimal processing depending on whether sources are industrial or small-scale (e.g., power plants or oil and gas heaters), concentrated or dilute (exhausts from combustion or air in confined spaces), and clean or contaminated with other pollutants.\n",
      "Many of the CO2-capture chemical processes that involve a capture agent such as amines or solid sorbents require temperature and/or pressure swings to release the captured CO2 and regenerate the agents for further capture. These swings result in inefficiencies due to energy wasted in heating solvents and sorbents, pressurizing feed gas, or drawing a vacuum for desorption. Electrochemical systems can minimize such parasitic energy losses as they can be operated at near isothermal conditions, with significantly higher efficiencies than their thermal-swing (TSA) and pressure-swing (PSA) adsorption counterparts.13 One mode of electrochemical capture of CO2 is through the use of a redox-active carrier.\n",
      "Electrochemically mediated selective transport of chemical species was first reported by Ward et al.,14 where a redox-active carrier (ferrous ion) was used to transport nitric oxide across a membrane. Since then, a number of systems have been developed for transporting chemical species by redox-active carriers that are activated at one electrode, to bind with the target species, and deactivated at the opposite electrode, to release the target and regenerate the carrier.15,16 Systems that have been proposed for the concentration of CO2 through this approach have been based on a number of different carrier molecules, such as quinones,17â€“20 4,4â€²-bipyridine,21 and thiolates.22,23 Quinones are of particular interest to this work for their superior electrochemical performance, serving as redox-active carriers for CO2 in electrochemically mediated separation processes. DuBois et al. demonstrated this possibility, and studied the thermodynamics of an electrochemical CO2 pumping system that utilizes quinones.18 More work followed, where Scovazzo et al. demonstrated the electrochemical separation of CO2 from <1% concentration gas mixtures using 2,6-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone as a carrier in ionic liquid (IL) and organic solvent electrolytes media,19 while Gurkan et al. screened a number of ILs to serve as suitable electrolytes for quinone carriers in an electrochemically mediated selective transport system for CO2.20 All of these systems, however, require the transport of the electrolyte and the dissolved carrier molecules between two electrodes in an electrochemical cell for capture and release of CO2. This limits their implementation in a number of applications where the requirement for flow systems and pumping, and the large footprint, are problematic.\n",
      "In this work, we develop a compact electrochemical device for CO2 capture that eliminates the requirement for complex flow systems, and that can be effective in the treatment of both high and low concentration feed streams. A quinone-utilizing faradaic electrochemical cell that fulfils these requirements and operates as an Electro-Swing Adsorption (ESA) process is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. The cell is comprised of two cathode electrode substrates coated with a CO2-binding quinoneâ€“carbon nanotube (Qâ€“CNT) composite sandwiching an anode electrode substrate coated with a ferroceneâ€“CNT (Fcâ€“CNT) composite, with separator membranes between the electrodes. This cell architecture is employed to maximize the CO2-binding surface area of the cell exposed to gas flow in a parallel passage adsorbent contactor design where stacks of these cells form parallel gas channels. The Fcâ€“CNT electrode serves as an electron source and sink for the reduction and oxidation, respectively, of the Qâ€“CNT electrodes to regulate the uptake and release of the CO2. Wetting of porous non-woven carbon fiber mats used as the electrode substrates by a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) electrolyte enables effective ionic currents to pass through the electrolyte on activation and deactivation of the electrodes, and permits the diffusion of CO2 into the electrolyte-wetted cathodes during capture.\n",
      "Fig. 1\n",
      "Schematic of a single electro-swing adsorption electrochemical cell with porous electrodes and electrolyte separators. The outer electrodes, coated with poly-1,4-anthraquinone composite, can capture CO2 on application of a reducing potential via carboxylation of quinone, and release the CO2 on reversal of the polarity. The inner polyvinylferrocene-containing electrode serves as an electron source and sink for the quinone reduction and oxidation, respectively.\n",
      "The effectiveness of the electro-swing concept for CO2 capture and release was demonstrated in a sealed system in which cell polarity was cycled to regulate the activation and deactivation of the carrier, i.e. reduction and oxidation of the redox active quinone. This was in lieu of the advection of the carrier electrolyte solution between two electrodes with a difference in potential.19 The performance of flow-through modules constructed with stacks of the assembled electrode cells was also assessed. The CO2 capture processes were modelled to provide greater insight into the operational principles for this technology.\n",
      "Ultimately, the goal of this work was to demonstrate an electrochemically activated packed parallel passage contactor adsorption system for the removal of CO2 from flue gas and other CO2-rich streams. The regeneration of the bed takes place on reversal of the polarity of the stack in an ESA, with analogies to PSA systems, where adsorption takes place at high pressure and desorption at a lower pressure,24 or TSA systems, where adsorption takes place at low temperatures and the fixed bed is regenerated at higher temperatures.25\n",
      "Results and discussion\n",
      "Design of the electrochemical cell\n",
      "Thin films of crystallized organic compounds have been studied as a means of immobilizing CO2 redox-active carriers onto electrode substrates.26 Redox-active polymers have long been the preferred electrode material when using organic molecules in electrochemical cells, however, because polymers are less soluble in the electrolyte than their corresponding redox-active repeating units, and thus the self-discharge of the cell can be avoided, and its cycling performance improved.27 For example, quinone polymers have been investigated as suitable cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries,28 and pseudocapacitive energy storage devices.29 These polymers are usually made into composites with conductive high-surface area carbon materials, such as carbon black, graphite or carbon nanotubes (CNT), to enhance the overall conductivity of the electrode material and increase the area of the polymer exposed to the electrolyte.30 Here, we used a polyanthraquinoneâ€“CNT (PAQâ€“CNT) composite for the cathode and polyvinylferroceneâ€“CNT (PVFcâ€“CNT) composite for the anode.31 The electrolyte used was the RTIL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bmim][TF2N]), selected for its low volatility, which allows for flow of gas over the wetted electrodes without loss of electrolyte to evaporation or entrainment.\n",
      "A sealed chamber was constructed in which CO2 capture and release on electrochemical activation and deactivation of the quinones, respectively, was indicated by the concomitant pressure changes in the chamber. A flow cell was also fabricated to house stacks of the electrochemical cells to allow for capture of CO2 from flowing gas streams of compositions similar to those of flue gases, air in aircraft cabins and buildings, and in the ambient environment. The adsorption effectiveness was assessed through analysis of the breakthrough profiles.\n",
      "The chemical specificity of quinones can provide near 100% purity of released CO2, which, when combined with a well-designed process in which 100% CO2 recovery is achieved, puts the technology much closer to the upper-right corner on the recovery-purity Pareto plot than those based on current CO2 sorbents.32,33\n",
      "Polyanthraquinone electrodes.\n",
      "Poly(1,4-anthraquinone) (P14AQ), shown in Fig. 1, was synthesized and incorporated into an ink with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Non-woven carbon fiber mat electrode substrates of thickness 150 Î¼m (35 g mâˆ’2) were dip-coated in the ink and dried very slowly to obtain a composite that uniformly coated the substrate at âˆ¼1.2 mg cmâˆ’2, shown in Fig. 2(a). The composite structure allows for a greater utilization of the anthraquinone repeating units in the polymers, and thus larger currents under applied potentials. The CNT mesh, shown in Fig. 2(f), provides a backbone to improve the conductivity of the conjugated PAQ via Ï€â€“Ï€ interactions with the anthraquinone units (Fig. S3, ESIâ€ ); it also provides a porous matrix decorated by the polymer chains for better electrolyte penetration. This results in a larger surface area of the polymer being exposed to electrolyte, and an increased conductivity in the composite.34 The Ï€â€“Ï€ interaction of the polymer chains and CNTs, and the subsequent decoration of the nanotubes with the polymer chains, shown in Fig. 2(e), also improved the suspension of the CNTs in the polymer solution, which resulted in very well dispersed inks. The ratio of PAQ to CNT was optimized, with the highest current per mass of active material (polymer) obtained at a 1:3, PAQ:CNT ratio by weight (Fig. S4, ESIâ€ ). The cyclic voltammograms in Fig. 3 shown in green (under N2) and red (under CO2) indicate the strong redox activity of these electrode surfaces; the differences in the current response following potential scans are discussed later.\n",

Therefore, the anode electrode material for the electrochemical cell with PAQâ€“CNT cathode was a composite of polyvinylferrocene and CNT (PVFcâ€“CNT), shown in Fig. 1. This was prepared by dispersing MWCNTs in a solution of PVFc in NMP. The optimum ratio of the composite was found to be 1:1, PVFc:CNT, by weight. The electrode substrate was dip-coated in the ink and dried slowly to yield a composite that uniformly coated the substrate at âˆ¼1.4 mg cmâˆ’2, as shown in Fig. 4. The CVs of the PVFcâ€“CNT electrode in N2 and CO2 saturated [Bmim][TF2N] are identical, and are indicated by the blue line in Fig. 3.

      "The electrochemical cell.\n",
      "The PAQâ€“CNT electrodes were assembled into an electrochemical cell in which CO2 was able to be captured and released upon potential swings. This was accomplished by layering a PVFcâ€“CNT counter electrode between the two PAQâ€“CNT electrodes to balance the charge of these electrodes, as shown in Fig. 5(d). In a CO2-rich environment, this afforded a polymer-based battery with an electrochemical window of âˆ¼1.2 V, where all the charge from the ferrocene oxidation, at its reduction potential, was balanced by the charge transferred to the two-electron reduction of quinone, at its first reduction potential. This window is defined by the reduction potential of PVFcâ€“CNT and the first reduction potential of PAQâ€“CNT, shown in Fig. 3 as Î”V1. However, in the absence of CO2 or other such electrophiles, mainly under N2, PAQ retains its two one-electron reductions, with half of the charge of the ferrocene oxidation being balanced by the reduction of quinone at the first potential and the other half by its reduction at the second potential. This results in a wider electrochemical window, shown in Fig. 3 as Î”V2, and the behavior of the cell resembles that of an asymmetric pseudocapacitor.35\n",

      "The capacities of the anode and cathodes of the cell, evaluated by gravimetric charge calibration of the two electrode composite materials (Fig. S5, ESIâ€ ), were balanced by requiring that mP14AQâ€“CNT = 1.12mPFVcâ€“CNT, which allowed for some excess PVFcâ€“CNT.\n",
      "Carbon capture\n",
      "Two different types of units were fabricated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the electro-swing process. The first was a sealed chamber into which the electrodes were inserted. Changes in pressure were measured as CO2 was adsorbed and then released on cycling of the potential applied to the electrodes. The second approach used a flow adsorption in which the CO2 exiting the device was monitored, with the breakthrough point reflecting the overall capacity of the electrodes. All carbon capture experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "CO2 capture and release in a batch system.\n",
      "An electrochemical cell (4 cm2 of total exposed area) with the three layers, such as that illustrated in Fig. 1, was tested for the capture and release of CO2 in a sealed chamber, shown in Fig. 5. This cell had âˆ¼4.8 mg of PAQâ€“CNT deposited, i.e. 5.8 Î¼mol of quinone, or a capacity for 11.6 Î¼mol of CO2. From the monitored pressure changes in the chamber of known internal void volume, the number of moles of CO2 captured and released upon charge and discharge of the cell at constant potentials, were calculated. The chamber was purged with CO2 at the desired concentrations and sealed at atmospheric pressure. The pressure inside was allowed to equilibrate at constant temperature before the electrochemical experiments were started.\n",
      "The performance of the electrochemical cell was evaluated in chronoamperometric (potentiostatic) experiments, with capture at 1.3 V and release at 0.5 V, i.e. Î”V = 0.8 V. Fig. 6(a) shows the change in the number of moles of CO2 captured from pure gas over 10 cycles (blue), along with the charge transferred to and from the cell (red). It shows that âˆ¼65% of the quinone units were utilized, i.e. 7.4 Î¼mol of CO2 captured. This may be due to incomplete charging of the quinones that are not exposed to electrolyte. From the charge transferred during charging and discharge (âˆ¼800 mC), and the moles of CO2 captured and released, a faradaic efficiencyÂ (1)of up to 90% was estimated, with some of the charge lost to double layer charging of the porous electrodes. Here, F is Faraday's constant, Q is the charge transferred, and n is the number of moles of useful electrons transferred in the reaction, i.e. used for the capture of CO2, which in this reaction, is equivalent to the number of moles of CO2. This efficiency results in âˆ¼86 kJ per mole of CO2 captured and released, as determined by the relationÂ (2)where Î”V is the difference between the applied charge and discharge potentials.\n",

(b) The CO2 captured under different feed concentrations. (c) Capacity of cell over 7000 cycles. In a different set of experiments using a larger cell and cavity, (d) shows the effect of varying charging potential for a 1000 s capture and (e) shows the effect of varying the capture duration at âˆ’1.8 V capture potential. These experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "Fig. 6(b) shows similar results for the capture of CO2 from gases of different concentrations ranging between 15 and 100%. Again, quinone utilization was high, but dependent on the initial gas concentration, owing not to capacity limitations, but to a reduction on sorption dynamics due to mass transfer limitations with lower concentration driving forces. The electrochemical cell showed great stability with <30% loss in capacity over 7000 cycles of capture and release, Fig. 6(c). The gradual loss in capacity is mainly due to the electromigration of the shorter polymer chains, Fig. S1 (ESIâ€ ), from the electrode and into the electrolyte, towards the opposite electrode.\n",
      "In a different set of experiments where a larger cell (âˆ¼450 cm2 of total exposed area) was used, CO2 transport limitations became more prominent due to the larger internal volume of the cavity used. In this set, the effect of applying an overpotential was studied, where capture potentials of greater than Î”V1 (in Fig. 3) were applied during a 1000 s capture experiment. Fig. 6(d) shows that upon increasing the applied capture potential more CO2 is captured for the duration of the experiment, which indicates the activation of more quinone units on the electrodes during the charging half-cycle. Charging the system at âˆ’1.8 V for varying durations, Fig. 6(e), shows that the system is fully charged after 2000 s, but more CO2 is captured, i.e. more of the quinones are utilized, at increasing durations of capture. This demonstrates the transport limitations of the electrodes, as explained in later sections.\n",
      "CO2 capture and release in flow systems.\n",
      "The adsorption bed assembled consisted of a few electrochemical cells stacked in the flow device to allow the flow of gas in between, as illustrated in Fig. 7(a). The blue regions indicate the presence of CO2, and the decrease in blue intensity within the channel indicates the adsorption front, ahead of which the bed is still empty, and behind which the bed, i.e. the electrode assembly, is saturated with CO2 and cannot adsorb more. A number of different cells were constructed in the flow bed configuration shown in Fig. 7(b). The exposed area of a typical cell was 18 cm Ã— 10 cm, with âˆ¼0.2 g of P14AQâ€“CNT composite; at âˆ¼70% useful quinones, this amounted to the adsorption of âˆ¼9â€“14 cm3 of CO2. The channels between the cells were typically âˆ¼500 Î¼m thick, and bed volumes were about 35 cm3 with a total bed weight of âˆ¼1.5 g bringing the productivity of the bed to 0.01â€“0.02 kg CO2 per kgbedtb, where tb is the breakthrough time, i.e. the time to reach saturation of the electrodes or for the outlet CO2 concentration to begin to increase. At feed flow rates of âˆ¼10 mL minâˆ’1 and 15% CO2, this productivity is on par with the TSA systems reported by Ntiamoah et al.36\n",

      "(a) Schematic illustration of the parallel passage electrochemical cell contactor. The blue region indicates the saturated zone and the development of the mass transfer zone. (b) Photograph of a flow bed with a stack of the electrochemical cells.\n",
      "It can be shown that axial flow dispersion within individual channels was minimal at most flow rates, and that the transport resistances resided primarily within the electrodes. Imperfect packing of the cells in the flow device by hand did, in some cases, lead to significant channeling and large-scale device axial dispersion, however, with broad breakthrough curves, but it is anticipated that under optimal manufacturing conditions these effects can be reduced significantly.\n",
      "The chronoamperometric experiments performed in the sealed system were repeated in a flow system. Mixtures of N2 and CO2 at different compositions were flown past the stack of assembled electrochemical cells. Upon reduction of the PAQâ€“CNT electrodes, CO2 was removed (captured) from the inlet stream, and the decrease in the concentration of CO2 was detected at the outlet stream. In these experiments the bed was fully activated by charging at a constant potential greater than Î”V22 to guarantee the complete reduction of the all accessible quinone units prior to adsorption. Experiments with an initial half activation, i.e., at Î”V1, followed by adsorption at constant potential, did not result in different breakthrough curves, mainly because the kinetics of the reduction and the adsorption reactions are much faster than the rates of mass transfer of CO2 into the film, as discussed later.\n",
      "The breakthrough profiles obtained for one flow system are shown in Fig. 8(a). Breakthrough was achieved at smaller bed volumes of gas treated for higher feed CO2 concentrations, where the bed volume is a time measure which represents the total volume of gas treated at any given time relative to the volume of the bed itself. The breakthrough curves superimpose when normalized by the inlet CO2 concentration, shown in Fig. 8(b), which indicates a consistent behavior of the bed, i.e. equal utilization of the overall adsorption capacity regardless of the inlet concentration, an indication of a rectangular equilibrium isotherm. Note in this particular module that, although the breakthrough curves themselves were sharp, prior to breakthrough there was a consistent effluent concentration of 20% of the feed concentration, the result of a bypassing of the active cells by 20% of the total gas flow. The overall capacity of the bed can be calculated from the area between the line at Cout/Cin = 1 and the normalized breakthrough curve. A contactor bed of a desired overall capacity can be designed by linear scaling from this overall capacity. With a larger bed, CO2 was fully captured from a stream at 10% inlet concentration, which is on the higher end for carbon capture applications as it mimics combustion exhaust. Up to 10 bed volumes of feed were treated before breakthrough was achieved, indicating capacity of greater than one bed volume of pure CO2. It has similarly been shown that complete removal of CO2 with a smaller stack of cells (a scaled down contactor), five replicate capture experiments were conducted on an inlet stream of âˆ¼0.8% CO2, Fig. 8(d), which mimics conditions for ventilation of confined living spaces, such as space modules, submarines and buildings. The breakthrough curves were unaffected by the prior history of the bed, indicating that complete regeneration and restoration of the bed capacity was attained during the desorption following each adsorption run.\n",

      "(a) Breakthrough profiles obtained at four inlet concentrations. (b) Same breakthrough profiles in (a) normalized by the inlet concentrations. (c) Breakthrough profile obtained from a large system operating at âˆ¼10% inlet concentration. (d) Breakthrough profiles obtained from five replicate runs of a smaller system operating at âˆ¼0.8% inlet concentration. These experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "The broadness of the breakthrough profiles in Fig. 8(c) and (d) can be attributed to the variation in channel width. Since the electrochemical cell stacks are hand-assembled and fitted into the bed, some variation in channel width along the same channel and the parallel channels can cause an uneven distribution of flow resulting in overlapping of multiple breakthrough profiles, which culminate in a broad overall profile. Also, mass-transfer dispersion plays a significant role in the broadness of the profiles. As is evident from the long durations for an effective capture in Fig. 6(e), and discussed later, mass transfer of CO2 into the electrodes is the rate controlling step, and this causes axial dispersion that widens the mass transfer zone in the channel, illustrated in Fig. 7(a), resulting in broad breakthrough profiles in this case.\n",
      "Mechanism of CO2 capture\n",
      "Mizen and Wrighton first demonstrated the reductive addition of CO2 to 9,10-phenanthrenequinone in aprotic electrolytes. Quinones undergo two reversible one-electron reductions in aprotic electrolytes, at two reduction potentials, as shown in Scheme 1(a) for anthraquinone. But in the presence of CO2, a single two-electron quasi-reversible reduction takes place at the first reduction potential, as shown in Scheme 1(b), where the CO2 molecule carboxylates the quinone resulting in a carbonate salt.37 Upon the first reduction of a quinone molecule, a semiquinone radical anion is produced. Some semiquinones, with sufficient electron density, i.e. sufficient Lewis base strength, can react with CO2 in a nucleophilic addition to form a carbonate salt. Semiquinones with lower electron density â€“ due to attached electron withdrawing groups â€“ do not have the nucleophilic strength to react with CO2.38 A semiquinone carboxylated by the reductive addition of CO2 has its negative charge isolated from the rest of the molecule by a Ïƒ-bond, rendering the carboxylated quinone aromatic ring(s) relatively neutral. Hence, the two-electron reduction of the parent quinone under CO2 occurs at the first reduction potential. The second reduction generates another nucleophilic center, i.e. the second oxygen of the quinone, which reacts with a second CO2 molecule to form a bis(carbonate) dianion salt â€“ the quinol dianion diadduct. A similar behavior is observed when quinones are reduced in protic electrolyte media and the reduced quinones react with protons to form two hydroxyl groups via a two-electron reduction.39\n",

      "(a) Two single-electron reduction waves of anthraquinone in the absence of electrophiles. (b) One two-electron reduction wave of anthraquinone in the presence of CO2.\n",
      "The nucleophilic addition reaction of reduced quinones occurs only with electrophiles with sufficient Lewis acidity, such as CO2, and not N2, hence the great selectivity in adsorption. Furthermore, water, in the treated gas stream, has minimal effect on carbon capture, mainly because the hydrophobicity of the IL used presents a considerable mass transfer resistance for water with very little retention,40 and any residual water in the IL phase merely stabilizes the reduced quinones,41 with no significant change to the electrochemical or chemical steps of the carbon capture process.20 While the presence of oxygen can cause the oxidation of some reduced quinones with a sufficiently negative reduction potential, through the formation of the superoxide radical anion O2Ë™âˆ’, it is possible to avoid any reactions with oxygen in the feed stream by carefully tuning the electron density of the quinone polymer.42\n",
      "The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the PAQâ€“CNT composite on the electrode substrate in [Bmim][TF2N] saturated with N2, the green line in Fig. 3, shows two redox couples corresponding to the two reduction potentials of anthraquinone. The cathodic and anodic peaks, however, are broader than those reported for solutions of quinone molecules in electrolytes,20 which can be ascribed to the slower electron exchange between differently-reduced redox units, i.e. neutral quinone, semiquinone (radical anion) and quinol dianion, along the Ï€-conjugated backbone of the polymer,43 and also to the diffusion and electromigration of electrolytic species into and out of the porous PAQâ€“CNT film.44 The expected disappearance of the second redox couple of the CV under CO2 was observed, as shown by the red line in Fig. 3, and attributed to the carboxylation of the reduced quinone units along the polymer chain facilitating the second electron reduction of anthraquinone at the first reduction potential, with the consequent increase in the current at that potential. The PAQâ€“CNT electrode can therefore be used to remove CO2 selectively from a gas mixture via nucleophilic addition, and regenerated via an electrochemical oxidation, with release of the CO2, as shown earlier. The two reduction potentials under N2 are E01 = âˆ’1.21 V and E02 = âˆ’1.63 V, vs. Fc. Under CO2 these two potentials coalesce to yield a single quasi-reversible redox couple at the first reduction potential observed under N2, i.e. E01.\n",
      "The separation of the oxidation and reduction peaks in the CVs reported is large, indicating sluggish electron transfer to the quinone repeat units on the polymer, and a thick diffusion layer in the porous electrode.44 While the ratio of polymer to CNT was optimized for the greatest gravimetric capacity, it is not the ideal ratio for conductivity. Some of the conductivity takes place through the backbone of the polymer, which contributes to the slow electron transfer. This, however, does not present a problem in the design of the contactor separation unit, since the rate limiting step in the CO2 capture process is the transport of CO2 and not electron transfer.\n",
      "The double carboxylation (CO2 addition) of anthraquinone to form the bis(carbonate) dianion follows an ECEC mechanism, as shown in Scheme 2(a). During a constant-current charging of the cell in the presence of a flux of CO2 towards the quinone units equal to, or higher than, the rate of the electrochemical reduction of the quinones, both of the reduction electrochemical reactions take place at the first reduction potential, E01. The molar flux of CO2, NCO2, towards the electrode (moles per unit area per second) should match the current density, J, at the electrode (charge per unit area per second), as in,Â (3)Conversely, if the flux of CO2 is lower than the rate of reduction, some of the semiquinones produced in the first reduction are not carboxylated but are instead reduced to quinol dianions at the more negative second potential, E02, as shown in Scheme 2(b). In this case, for the same number of moles of semiquinone being reduced, and hence electrons, i.e. charge, transferred, more energy is required in accordance with eqn (2).\n",

      "CO2 deprivation was not a problem in the highly saturated electrolyte in the CV electrochemical characterizations, where the concentration of CO2 in the electrolyte was about 20 times higher than that of the quinones on the electrode. However, in an adsorption system, where the electrolyte is not saturated with CO2 there needs to be a careful balance between the advective and diffusive fluxes of CO2 towards the anthraquinone cathodes for reductive addition, and the rate of the reduction of anthraquinone. This can be better controlled by charging the cell, i.e. reducing the anthraquinone, at a constant potential that is sufficient to drive the first reduction of anthraquinone but not the second, i.e. charging the cell at a potential difference that is between Î”V1 and Î”V2. With operation at this constant potential, the flux of CO2 does not affect the energy of binding, since the second electron is acquired by a semiquinone at the first reduction potential, but only after the first CO2 addition occurs; following this second reduction, a second CO2 molecule can bind to the dianion monoadduct. When the first reduction is allowed in a CO2-lean environment at a constant potential, the current observed after the initial surge, which results from the first reduction, is proportional to the flux of CO2 towards the anthraquinone electrode. Nevertheless, this current ultimately diminishes due to the decrease in the number of semiquinones available to react with CO2. In a CO2-rich environment, at constant potential charging, the observed current after the initial surge is proportional to the transport of CO2 into the electrode and the rate of the addition reaction which follows the nucleophilic addition mechanism between semiquinones and dissolved CO2,Â R = kCQË™âˆ’CCO2,IL(4)where R is the rate of the reaction and k is the rate constant. The electrochemical steps proceed at a faster rate than the chemical reactions, but both types of reactions have rates that are faster than the rate of diffusion of CO2 in the IL, leading to a large DamkÃ¶hler number,Â (5)where CQ is the initial concentration of anthraquinone repeat units on the electrode, CCO2 is the concentration of CO2 in the IL, L is the thickness of the IL-wetted porous electrode, which is about 150 Î¼m, and DCO2,IL is the diffusion coefficient of CO2 in the IL and is about 4 Ã— 10âˆ’10 m2 sâˆ’1. While it is the semiquinone that participates in the reaction here, the initial concentration CQ is a good approximation for estimating the order of magnitude of Da. The rate constant can be estimated to be 102 Mâˆ’1 sâˆ’1,37 resulting in Da âˆ¼104. Large values of Da indicate that mass transfer will control the process and thus the charging and subsequent carboxylation of the quinones can be assumed to be in equilibrium with the prevailing CO2 concentration at any position and at any time. Therefore, with a reduced thickness of the electrodes, the CO2 mass transfer rates will approach that of the nucleophilic addition reaction.\n",

      ", Accepted 30th September 2019First published on 1st October 2019AbstractCarbon capture is one of the foremost methods for curtailing greenhouse gas emissions. Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinoneâ€“carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40â€“90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\n",
      "Broader context\n",
      "There is a clear scientific consensus on the role of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the unusually wild fluctuations of global climate patterns over the last century, to which carbon dioxide is the largest contributor. This has generated a scientific tide in the study of carbon removal techniques over the last three decades, which has slowly gathered momentum, culminating in the 2015 Paris Agreement, which heavily emphasized the role of carbon removal by tackling emissions or via negative emissions technologies. While a path forward for carbon capture is being shaped by a mix of incumbent actors and newcomers, the great majority of the proposed processes rely on conventional concepts. Moreover, most of these processes have a large balance of plant which hinders their potential to flexibly adapt to the multi-scale nature of carbon capture. Herein, we demonstrate a new approach which presents a paradigm shift in adsorption type processes and carbon capture. The electro-swing basis of our process allows its linear scaling with desired capacity and lends it geometric flexibility. It also allows carbon capture from streams of any concentration, and its release into any carrier streams, including pure CO2, with a low balance of plant.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "With the alarming increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and its implications for global climate pattern developments,1,2 mitigation of climate change through curtailment of anthropogenic CO2 emissions has been one of the most urgent socioeconomic and scientific problems in the global arena over the last decade.3 To this end, a number of technologies have been developed for the large-scale capture of CO2 from combustion and other industrial processes to produce high-purity CO2 streams for storage or valorization.4 The most mature of these technologies are solvent scrubbing, mainly amine scrubbing,5 and oxyfuel combustion,6 which target high CO2 concentration streams (>10%). These approaches have a large footprint and, when retrofitted to a process, can require major modifications to the plant. Consequently, there has been a major effort to develop new materials and processes for high efficiency CO2-capture, including sorbents for pressure and temperature swing adsorption systems,7 and membranes for selective transport of the CO2.8 Furthermore, many potential applications of carbon capture require compact devices due to space limitations, such as in the direct capture of CO2 from tailpipe exhausts on board mobile sources, in which there is growing interest given the large contribution of transportation exhaust to greenhouse gas emissions (33.5% of U.S. CO2 emissions in 2016).9\n",
      "In addition to the capture of CO2 from direct combustion processes, there is a need to remove CO2 from enclosed spaces for ventilation purposes in buildings and car cabins, or for cabin environmental control systems on board spacecraft and submarines, where the maximum allowed CO2 concentration in habitable spaces is 5000 ppm (or 0.5%).10 The first of such systems was developed by Winnick et al., for the electrochemical capture of CO2 in spacecraft cabins using molten carbonates.11 However, the low concentration of CO2 in such applications poses a challenge, mainly due to the low driving forces for mass transfer and the large quantities of other species present in air in addition to CO2.12 Thus, carbon capture is a multi-scale problem, where the CO2-rich streams to be treated vary greatly in volume, concentration and composition, and different criteria need to be fulfilled to ensure optimal processing depending on whether sources are industrial or small-scale (e.g., power plants or oil and gas heaters), concentrated or dilute (exhausts from combustion or air in confined spaces), and clean or contaminated with other pollutants.\n",
      "Many of the CO2-capture chemical processes that involve a capture agent such as amines or solid sorbents require temperature and/or pressure swings to release the captured CO2 and regenerate the agents for further capture. These swings result in inefficiencies due to energy wasted in heating solvents and sorbents, pressurizing feed gas, or drawing a vacuum for desorption. Electrochemical systems can minimize such parasitic energy losses as they can be operated at near isothermal conditions, with significantly higher efficiencies than their thermal-swing (TSA) and pressure-swing (PSA) adsorption counterparts.13 One mode of electrochemical capture of CO2 is through the use of a redox-active carrier.\n",
      "Electrochemically mediated selective transport of chemical species was first reported by Ward et al.,14 where a redox-active carrier (ferrous ion) was used to transport nitric oxide across a membrane. Since then, a number of systems have been developed for transporting chemical species by redox-active carriers that are activated at one electrode, to bind with the target species, and deactivated at the opposite electrode, to release the target and regenerate the carrier.15,16 Systems that have been proposed for the concentration of CO2 through this approach have been based on a number of different carrier molecules, such as quinones,17â€“20 4,4â€²-bipyridine,21 and thiolates.22,23 Quinones are of particular interest to this work for their superior electrochemical performance, serving as redox-active carriers for CO2 in electrochemically mediated separation processes. DuBois et al. demonstrated this possibility, and studied the thermodynamics of an electrochemical CO2 pumping system that utilizes quinones.18 More work followed, where Scovazzo et al. demonstrated the electrochemical separation of CO2 from <1% concentration gas mixtures using 2,6-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone as a carrier in ionic liquid (IL) and organic solvent electrolytes media,19 while Gurkan et al. screened a number of ILs to serve as suitable electrolytes for quinone carriers in an electrochemically mediated selective transport system for CO2.20 All of these systems, however, require the transport of the electrolyte and the dissolved carrier molecules between two electrodes in an electrochemical cell for capture and release of CO2. This limits their implementation in a number of applications where the requirement for flow systems and pumping, and the large footprint, are problematic.\n",
      "In this work, we develop a compact electrochemical device for CO2 capture that eliminates the requirement for complex flow systems, and that can be effective in the treatment of both high and low concentration feed streams. A quinone-utilizing faradaic electrochemical cell that fulfils these requirements and operates as an Electro-Swing Adsorption (ESA) process is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. The cell is comprised of two cathode electrode substrates coated with a CO2-binding quinoneâ€“carbon nanotube (Qâ€“CNT) composite sandwiching an anode electrode substrate coated with a ferroceneâ€“CNT (Fcâ€“CNT) composite, with separator membranes between the electrodes. This cell architecture is employed to maximize the CO2-binding surface area of the cell exposed to gas flow in a parallel passage adsorbent contactor design where stacks of these cells form parallel gas channels. The Fcâ€“CNT electrode serves as an electron source and sink for the reduction and oxidation, respectively, of the Qâ€“CNT electrodes to regulate the uptake and release of the CO2. Wetting of porous non-woven carbon fiber mats used as the electrode substrates by a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) electrolyte enables effective ionic currents to pass through the electrolyte on activation and deactivation of the electrodes, and permits the diffusion of CO2 into the electrolyte-wetted cathodes during capture.\n",

      "Schematic of a single electro-swing adsorption electrochemical cell with porous electrodes and electrolyte separators. The outer electrodes, coated with poly-1,4-anthraquinone composite, can capture CO2 on application of a reducing potential via carboxylation of quinone, and release the CO2 on reversal of the polarity. The inner polyvinylferrocene-containing electrode serves as an electron source and sink for the quinone reduction and oxidation, respectively.\n",
      "The effectiveness of the electro-swing concept for CO2 capture and release was demonstrated in a sealed system in which cell polarity was cycled to regulate the activation and deactivation of the carrier, i.e. reduction and oxidation of the redox active quinone. This was in lieu of the advection of the carrier electrolyte solution between two electrodes with a difference in potential.19 The performance of flow-through modules constructed with stacks of the assembled electrode cells was also assessed. The CO2 capture processes were modelled to provide greater insight into the operational principles for this technology.\n",
      "Ultimately, the goal of this work was to demonstrate an electrochemically activated packed parallel passage contactor adsorption system for the removal of CO2 from flue gas and other CO2-rich streams. The regeneration of the bed takes place on reversal of the polarity of the stack in an ESA, with analogies to PSA systems, where adsorption takes place at high pressure and desorption at a lower pressure,24 or TSA systems, where adsorption takes place at low temperatures and the fixed bed is regenerated at higher temperatures.25\n",
      "Results and discussion\n",
      "Design of the electrochemical cell\n",
      "Thin films of crystallized organic compounds have been studied as a means of immobilizing CO2 redox-active carriers onto electrode substrates.26 Redox-active polymers have long been the preferred electrode material when using organic molecules in electrochemical cells, however, because polymers are less soluble in the electrolyte than their corresponding redox-active repeating units, and thus the self-discharge of the cell can be avoided, and its cycling performance improved.27 For example, quinone polymers have been investigated as suitable cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries,28 and pseudocapacitive energy storage devices.29 These polymers are usually made into composites with conductive high-surface area carbon materials, such as carbon black, graphite or carbon nanotubes (CNT), to enhance the overall conductivity of the electrode material and increase the area of the polymer exposed to the electrolyte.30 Here, we used a polyanthraquinoneâ€“CNT (PAQâ€“CNT) composite for the cathode and polyvinylferroceneâ€“CNT (PVFcâ€“CNT) composite for the anode.31 The electrolyte used was the RTIL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bmim][TF2N]), selected for its low volatility, which allows for flow of gas over the wetted electrodes without loss of electrolyte to evaporation or entrainment.\n",
      "A sealed chamber was constructed in which CO2 capture and release on electrochemical activation and deactivation of the quinones, respectively, was indicated by the concomitant pressure changes in the chamber. A flow cell was also fabricated to house stacks of the electrochemical cells to allow for capture of CO2 from flowing gas streams of compositions similar to those of flue gases, air in aircraft cabins and buildings, and in the ambient environment. The adsorption effectiveness was assessed through analysis of the breakthrough profiles.\n",
      "The chemical specificity of quinones can provide near 100% purity of released CO2, which, when combined with a well-designed process in which 100% CO2 recovery is achieved, puts the technology much closer to the upper-right corner on the recovery-purity Pareto plot than those based on current CO2 sorbents.32,33\n",
      "Polyanthraquinone electrodes.\n",
      "Poly(1,4-anthraquinone) (P14AQ), shown in Fig. 1, was synthesized and incorporated into an ink with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Non-woven carbon fiber mat electrode substrates of thickness 150 Î¼m (35 g mâˆ’2) were dip-coated in the ink and dried very slowly to obtain a composite that uniformly coated the substrate at âˆ¼1.2 mg cmâˆ’2, shown in Fig. 2(a). The composite structure allows for a greater utilization of the anthraquinone repeating units in the polymers, and thus larger currents under applied potentials. The CNT mesh, shown in Fig. 2(f), provides a backbone to improve the conductivity of the conjugated PAQ via Ï€â€“Ï€ interactions with the anthraquinone units (Fig. S3, ESIâ€ ); it also provides a porous matrix decorated by the polymer chains for better electrolyte penetration. This results in a larger surface area of the polymer being exposed to electrolyte, and an increased conductivity in the composite.34 The Ï€â€“Ï€ interaction of the polymer chains and CNTs, and the subsequent decoration of the nanotubes with the polymer chains, shown in Fig. 2(e), also improved the suspension of the CNTs in the polymer solution, which resulted in very well dispersed inks. The ratio of PAQ to CNT was optimized, with the highest current per mass of active material (polymer) obtained at a 1:3, PAQ:CNT ratio by weight (Fig. S4, ESIâ€ ). The cyclic voltammograms in Fig. 3 shown in green (under N2) and red (under CO2) indicate the strong redox activity of these electrode surfaces; the differences in the current response following potential scans are discussed later.\n",

      "A counter electrode with a reduction potential more positive than the oxidative CO2 release potential of PAQâ€“CNT is required to make an electrochemical cell that can effectively capture and release CO2. Therefore, the anode electrode material for the electrochemical cell with PAQâ€“CNT cathode was a composite of polyvinylferrocene and CNT (PVFcâ€“CNT), shown in Fig. 1. This was prepared by dispersing MWCNTs in a solution of PVFc in NMP. The optimum ratio of the composite was found to be 1:1, PVFc:CNT, by weight. The electrode substrate was dip-coated in the ink and dried slowly to yield a composite that uniformly coated the substrate at âˆ¼1.4 mg cmâˆ’2, as shown in Fig. 4. The CVs of the PVFcâ€“CNT electrode in N2 and CO2 saturated [Bmim][TF2N] are identical, and are indicated by the blue line in Fig. 3.

      "The electrochemical cell.\n",
      "The PAQâ€“CNT electrodes were assembled into an electrochemical cell in which CO2 was able to be captured and released upon potential swings. This was accomplished by layering a PVFcâ€“CNT counter electrode between the two PAQâ€“CNT electrodes to balance the charge of these electrodes, as shown in Fig. 5(d). In a CO2-rich environment, this afforded a polymer-based battery with an electrochemical window of âˆ¼1.2 V, where all the charge from the ferrocene oxidation, at its reduction potential, was balanced by the charge transferred to the two-electron reduction of quinone, at its first reduction potential. This window is defined by the reduction potential of PVFcâ€“CNT and the first reduction potential of PAQâ€“CNT, shown in Fig. 3 as Î”V1. However, in the absence of CO2 or other such electrophiles, mainly under N2, PAQ retains its two one-electron reductions, with half of the charge of the ferrocene oxidation being balanced by the reduction of quinone at the first potential and the other half by its reduction at the second potential. This results in a wider electrochemical window, shown in Fig. 3 as Î”V2, and the behavior of the cell resembles that of an asymmetric pseudocapacitor.35\n",

      "The capacities of the anode and cathodes of the cell, evaluated by gravimetric charge calibration of the two electrode composite materials (Fig. S5, ESIâ€ ), were balanced by requiring that mP14AQâ€“CNT = 1.12mPFVcâ€“CNT, which allowed for some excess PVFcâ€“CNT.\n",
      "Carbon capture\n",
      "Two different types of units were fabricated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the electro-swing process. The first was a sealed chamber into which the electrodes were inserted. Changes in pressure were measured as CO2 was adsorbed and then released on cycling of the potential applied to the electrodes. The second approach used a flow adsorption in which the CO2 exiting the device was monitored, with the breakthrough point reflecting the overall capacity of the electrodes. All carbon capture experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "CO2 capture and release in a batch system.\n",
      "An electrochemical cell (4 cm2 of total exposed area) with the three layers, such as that illustrated in Fig. 1, was tested for the capture and release of CO2 in a sealed chamber, shown in Fig. 5. This cell had âˆ¼4.8 mg of PAQâ€“CNT deposited, i.e. 5.8 Î¼mol of quinone, or a capacity for 11.6 Î¼mol of CO2. From the monitored pressure changes in the chamber of known internal void volume, the number of moles of CO2 captured and released upon charge and discharge of the cell at constant potentials, were calculated. The chamber was purged with CO2 at the desired concentrations and sealed at atmospheric pressure. The pressure inside was allowed to equilibrate at constant temperature before the electrochemical experiments were started.\n",
      "The performance of the electrochemical cell was evaluated in chronoamperometric (potentiostatic) experiments, with capture at 1.3 V and release at 0.5 V, i.e. Î”V = 0.8 V. Fig. 6(a) shows the change in the number of moles of CO2 captured from pure gas over 10 cycles (blue), along with the charge transferred to and from the cell (red). It shows that âˆ¼65% of the quinone units were utilized, i.e. 7.4 Î¼mol of CO2 captured. This may be due to incomplete charging of the quinones that are not exposed to electrolyte. From the charge transferred during charging and discharge (âˆ¼800 mC), and the moles of CO2 captured and released, a faradaic efficiencyÂ (1)of up to 90% was estimated, with some of the charge lost to double layer charging of the porous electrodes. Here, F is Faraday's constant, Q is the charge transferred, and n is the number of moles of useful electrons transferred in the reaction, i.e. used for the capture of CO2, which in this reaction, is equivalent to the number of moles of CO2. This efficiency results in âˆ¼86 kJ per mole of CO2 captured and released, as determined by the relationÂ (2)where Î”V is the difference between the applied charge and discharge potentials.\n",

      "(a) Changes in the number of moles of CO2 captured upon charging and discharge of the electrochemical cell over 10 cycles, normalized by the moles of quinone on the electrode ().

(b) The CO2 captured under different feed concentrations. (c) Capacity of cell over 7000 cycles. In a different set of experiments using a larger cell and cavity, (d) shows the effect of varying charging potential for a 1000 s capture and (e) shows the effect of varying the capture duration at âˆ’1.8 V capture potential. These experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "Fig. 6(b) shows similar results for the capture of CO2 from gases of different concentrations ranging between 15 and 100%. Again, quinone utilization was high, but dependent on the initial gas concentration, owing not to capacity limitations, but to a reduction on sorption dynamics due to mass transfer limitations with lower concentration driving forces. The electrochemical cell showed great stability with <30% loss in capacity over 7000 cycles of capture and release, Fig. 6(c). The gradual loss in capacity is mainly due to the electromigration of the shorter polymer chains, Fig. S1 (ESIâ€ ), from the electrode and into the electrolyte, towards the opposite electrode.\n",
      "In a different set of experiments where a larger cell (âˆ¼450 cm2 of total exposed area) was used, CO2 transport limitations became more prominent due to the larger internal volume of the cavity used. In this set, the effect of applying an overpotential was studied, where capture potentials of greater than Î”V1 (in Fig. 3) were applied during a 1000 s capture experiment. Fig. 6(d) shows that upon increasing the applied capture potential more CO2 is captured for the duration of the experiment, which indicates the activation of more quinone units on the electrodes during the charging half-cycle. Charging the system at âˆ’1.8 V for varying durations, Fig. 6(e), shows that the system is fully charged after 2000 s, but more CO2 is captured, i.e. more of the quinones are utilized, at increasing durations of capture. This demonstrates the transport limitations of the electrodes, as explained in later sections.\n",
      "CO2 capture and release in flow systems.\n",
      "The adsorption bed assembled consisted of a few electrochemical cells stacked in the flow device to allow the flow of gas in between, as illustrated in Fig. 7(a). The blue regions indicate the presence of CO2, and the decrease in blue intensity within the channel indicates the adsorption front, ahead of which the bed is still empty, and behind which the bed, i.e. the electrode assembly, is saturated with CO2 and cannot adsorb more. A number of different cells were constructed in the flow bed configuration shown in Fig. 7(b). The exposed area of a typical cell was 18 cm Ã— 10 cm, with âˆ¼0.2 g of P14AQâ€“CNT composite; at âˆ¼70% useful quinones, this amounted to the adsorption of âˆ¼9â€“14 cm3 of CO2. The channels between the cells were typically âˆ¼500 Î¼m thick, and bed volumes were about 35 cm3 with a total bed weight of âˆ¼1.5 g bringing the productivity of the bed to 0.01â€“0.02 kg CO2 per kgbedtb, where tb is the breakthrough time, i.e. the time to reach saturation of the electrodes or for the outlet CO2 concentration to begin to increase. At feed flow rates of âˆ¼10 mL minâˆ’1 and 15% CO2, this productivity is on par with the TSA systems reported by Ntiamoah et al.36\n",

      "(a) Schematic illustration of the parallel passage electrochemical cell contactor. The blue region indicates the saturated zone and the development of the mass transfer zone. (b) Photograph of a flow bed with a stack of the electrochemical cells.\n",
      "It can be shown that axial flow dispersion within individual channels was minimal at most flow rates, and that the transport resistances resided primarily within the electrodes. Imperfect packing of the cells in the flow device by hand did, in some cases, lead to significant channeling and large-scale device axial dispersion, however, with broad breakthrough curves, but it is anticipated that under optimal manufacturing conditions these effects can be reduced significantly.\n",
      "The chronoamperometric experiments performed in the sealed system were repeated in a flow system. Mixtures of N2 and CO2 at different compositions were flown past the stack of assembled electrochemical cells. Upon reduction of the PAQâ€“CNT electrodes, CO2 was removed (captured) from the inlet stream, and the decrease in the concentration of CO2 was detected at the outlet stream. In these experiments the bed was fully activated by charging at a constant potential greater than Î”V22 to guarantee the complete reduction of the all accessible quinone units prior to adsorption. Experiments with an initial half activation, i.e., at Î”V1, followed by adsorption at constant potential, did not result in different breakthrough curves, mainly because the kinetics of the reduction and the adsorption reactions are much faster than the rates of mass transfer of CO2 into the film, as discussed later.\n",
      "The breakthrough profiles obtained for one flow system are shown in Fig. 8(a). Breakthrough was achieved at smaller bed volumes of gas treated for higher feed CO2 concentrations, where the bed volume is a time measure which represents the total volume of gas treated at any given time relative to the volume of the bed itself. The breakthrough curves superimpose when normalized by the inlet CO2 concentration, shown in Fig. 8(b), which indicates a consistent behavior of the bed, i.e. equal utilization of the overall adsorption capacity regardless of the inlet concentration, an indication of a rectangular equilibrium isotherm. Note in this particular module that, although the breakthrough curves themselves were sharp, prior to breakthrough there was a consistent effluent concentration of 20% of the feed concentration, the result of a bypassing of the active cells by 20% of the total gas flow. The overall capacity of the bed can be calculated from the area between the line at Cout/Cin = 1 and the normalized breakthrough curve. A contactor bed of a desired overall capacity can be designed by linear scaling from this overall capacity. With a larger bed, CO2 was fully captured from a stream at 10% inlet concentration, which is on the higher end for carbon capture applications as it mimics combustion exhaust. Up to 10 bed volumes of feed were treated before breakthrough was achieved, indicating capacity of greater than one bed volume of pure CO2. It has similarly been shown that complete removal of CO2 with a smaller stack of cells (a scaled down contactor), five replicate capture experiments were conducted on an inlet stream of âˆ¼0.8% CO2, Fig. 8(d), which mimics conditions for ventilation of confined living spaces, such as space modules, submarines and buildings. The breakthrough curves were unaffected by the prior history of the bed, indicating that complete regeneration and restoration of the bed capacity was attained during the desorption following each adsorption run.\n",

      "(a) Breakthrough profiles obtained at four inlet concentrations. (b) Same breakthrough profiles in (a) normalized by the inlet concentrations. (c) Breakthrough profile obtained from a large system operating at âˆ¼10% inlet concentration. (d) Breakthrough profiles obtained from five replicate runs of a smaller system operating at âˆ¼0.8% inlet concentration. These experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "The broadness of the breakthrough profiles in Fig. 8(c) and (d) can be attributed to the variation in channel width. Since the electrochemical cell stacks are hand-assembled and fitted into the bed, some variation in channel width along the same channel and the parallel channels can cause an uneven distribution of flow resulting in overlapping of multiple breakthrough profiles, which culminate in a broad overall profile. Also, mass-transfer dispersion plays a significant role in the broadness of the profiles. As is evident from the long durations for an effective capture in Fig. 6(e), and discussed later, mass transfer of CO2 into the electrodes is the rate controlling step, and this causes axial dispersion that widens the mass transfer zone in the channel, illustrated in Fig. 7(a), resulting in broad breakthrough profiles in this case.\n",
      "Mechanism of CO2 capture\n",
      "Mizen and Wrighton first demonstrated the reductive addition of CO2 to 9,10-phenanthrenequinone in aprotic electrolytes. Quinones undergo two reversible one-electron reductions in aprotic electrolytes, at two reduction potentials, as shown in Scheme 1(a) for anthraquinone. But in the presence of CO2, a single two-electron quasi-reversible reduction takes place at the first reduction potential, as shown in Scheme 1(b), where the CO2 molecule carboxylates the quinone resulting in a carbonate salt.37 Upon the first reduction of a quinone molecule, a semiquinone radical anion is produced. Some semiquinones, with sufficient electron density, i.e. sufficient Lewis base strength, can react with CO2 in a nucleophilic addition to form a carbonate salt. Semiquinones with lower electron density â€“ due to attached electron withdrawing groups â€“ do not have the nucleophilic strength to react with CO2.38 A semiquinone carboxylated by the reductive addition of CO2 has its negative charge isolated from the rest of the molecule by a Ïƒ-bond, rendering the carboxylated quinone aromatic ring(s) relatively neutral. Hence, the two-electron reduction of the parent quinone under CO2 occurs at the first reduction potential. The second reduction generates another nucleophilic center, i.e. the second oxygen of the quinone, which reacts with a second CO2 molecule to form a bis(carbonate) dianion salt â€“ the quinol dianion diadduct. A similar behavior is observed when quinones are reduced in protic electrolyte media and the reduced quinones react with protons to form two hydroxyl groups via a two-electron reduction.39\n",

      "(a) Two single-electron reduction waves of anthraquinone in the absence of electrophiles. (b) One two-electron reduction wave of anthraquinone in the presence of CO2.\n",
      "The nucleophilic addition reaction of reduced quinones occurs only with electrophiles with sufficient Lewis acidity, such as CO2, and not N2, hence the great selectivity in adsorption. Furthermore, water, in the treated gas stream, has minimal effect on carbon capture, mainly because the hydrophobicity of the IL used presents a considerable mass transfer resistance for water with very little retention,40 and any residual water in the IL phase merely stabilizes the reduced quinones,41 with no significant change to the electrochemical or chemical steps of the carbon capture process.20 While the presence of oxygen can cause the oxidation of some reduced quinones with a sufficiently negative reduction potential, through the formation of the superoxide radical anion O2Ë™âˆ’, it is possible to avoid any reactions with oxygen in the feed stream by carefully tuning the electron density of the quinone polymer.42\n",
      "The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the PAQâ€“CNT composite on the electrode substrate in [Bmim][TF2N] saturated with N2, the green line in Fig. 3, shows two redox couples corresponding to the two reduction potentials of anthraquinone. The cathodic and anodic peaks, however, are broader than those reported for solutions of quinone molecules in electrolytes,20 which can be ascribed to the slower electron exchange between differently-reduced redox units, i.e. neutral quinone, semiquinone (radical anion) and quinol dianion, along the Ï€-conjugated backbone of the polymer,43 and also to the diffusion and electromigration of electrolytic species into and out of the porous PAQâ€“CNT film.44 The expected disappearance of the second redox couple of the CV under CO2 was observed, as shown by the red line in Fig. 3, and attributed to the carboxylation of the reduced quinone units along the polymer chain facilitating the second electron reduction of anthraquinone at the first reduction potential, with the consequent increase in the current at that potential. The PAQâ€“CNT electrode can therefore be used to remove CO2 selectively from a gas mixture via nucleophilic addition, and regenerated via an electrochemical oxidation, with release of the CO2, as shown earlier. The two reduction potentials under N2 are E01 = âˆ’1.21 V and E02 = âˆ’1.63 V, vs. Fc. Under CO2 these two potentials coalesce to yield a single quasi-reversible redox couple at the first reduction potential observed under N2, i.e. E01.\n",
      "The separation of the oxidation and reduction peaks in the CVs reported is large, indicating sluggish electron transfer to the quinone repeat units on the polymer, and a thick diffusion layer in the porous electrode.44 While the ratio of polymer to CNT was optimized for the greatest gravimetric capacity, it is not the ideal ratio for conductivity. Some of the conductivity takes place through the backbone of the polymer, which contributes to the slow electron transfer. This, however, does not present a problem in the design of the contactor separation unit, since the rate limiting step in the CO2 capture process is the transport of CO2 and not electron transfer.\n",
      "The double carboxylation (CO2 addition) of anthraquinone to form the bis(carbonate) dianion follows an ECEC mechanism, as shown in Scheme 2(a). During a constant-current charging of the cell in the presence of a flux of CO2 towards the quinone units equal to, or higher than, the rate of the electrochemical reduction of the quinones, both of the reduction electrochemical reactions take place at the first reduction potential, E01. The molar flux of CO2, NCO2, towards the electrode (moles per unit area per second) should match the current density, J, at the electrode (charge per unit area per second), as in,Â (3)Conversely, if the flux of CO2 is lower than the rate of reduction, some of the semiquinones produced in the first reduction are not carboxylated but are instead reduced to quinol dianions at the more negative second potential, E02, as shown in Scheme 2(b). In this case, for the same number of moles of semiquinone being reduced, and hence electrons, i.e. charge, transferred, more energy is required in accordance with eqn (2).\n",

      "CO2 deprivation was not a problem in the highly saturated electrolyte in the CV electrochemical characterizations, where the concentration of CO2 in the electrolyte was about 20 times higher than that of the quinones on the electrode. However, in an adsorption system, where the electrolyte is not saturated with CO2 there needs to be a careful balance between the advective and diffusive fluxes of CO2 towards the anthraquinone cathodes for reductive addition, and the rate of the reduction of anthraquinone. This can be better controlled by charging the cell, i.e. reducing the anthraquinone, at a constant potential that is sufficient to drive the first reduction of anthraquinone but not the second, i.e. charging the cell at a potential difference that is between Î”V1 and Î”V2. With operation at this constant potential, the flux of CO2 does not affect the energy of binding, since the second electron is acquired by a semiquinone at the first reduction potential, but only after the first CO2 addition occurs; following this second reduction, a second CO2 molecule can bind to the dianion monoadduct. When the first reduction is allowed in a CO2-lean environment at a constant potential, the current observed after the initial surge, which results from the first reduction, is proportional to the flux of CO2 towards the anthraquinone electrode. Nevertheless, this current ultimately diminishes due to the decrease in the number of semiquinones available to react with CO2. In a CO2-rich environment, at constant potential charging, the observed current after the initial surge is proportional to the transport of CO2 into the electrode and the rate of the addition reaction which follows the nucleophilic addition mechanism between semiquinones and dissolved CO2,Â R = kCQË™âˆ’CCO2,IL(4)where R is the rate of the reaction and k is the rate constant. The electrochemical steps proceed at a faster rate than the chemical reactions, but both types of reactions have rates that are faster than the rate of diffusion of CO2 in the IL, leading to a large DamkÃ¶hler number,Â (5)where CQ is the initial concentration of anthraquinone repeat units on the electrode, CCO2 is the concentration of CO2 in the IL, L is the thickness of the IL-wetted porous electrode, which is about 150 Î¼m, and DCO2,IL is the diffusion coefficient of CO2 in the IL and is about 4 Ã— 10âˆ’10 m2 sâˆ’1. While it is the semiquinone that participates in the reaction here, the initial concentration CQ is a good approximation for estimating the order of magnitude of Da. The rate constant can be estimated to be 102 Mâˆ’1 sâˆ’1,37 resulting in Da âˆ¼104. Large values of Da indicate that mass transfer will control the process and thus the charging and subsequent carboxylation of the quinones can be assumed to be in equilibrium with the prevailing CO2 concentration at any position and at any time. Therefore, with a reduced thickness of the electrodes, the CO2 mass transfer rates will approach that of the nucleophilic addition reaction.\n",

      "Carbon capture is one of the foremost methods for curtailing greenhouse gas emissions. Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\n",

In the first two electrochemical reactions shown in Scheme 2(a), the reduced species are QË™âˆ’ and Q(CO2)2âˆ’, while the species of higher oxidation number in these two reactions are Q and Q(CO2)Ë™âˆ’ respectively. The standard reduction potential for both reactions is E01. While the first of the two electrochemical reactions in Scheme 2(b) is the same as that of Scheme 2(a), the second reaction has Q2âˆ’ as the reduced species and QË™âˆ’ as the species with higher oxidation number, with a standard reduction potential of E02. Likewise, in the anode oxidation reaction, Fc+ (ferrocenium) is the oxidized species and Fc (ferrocene) is the reduced species at E0 = âˆ’0.03 V. The current densities of these reactions were described by the Butlerâ€“Volmer equation,Â (7)where Î· is the overpotential and Î±, the symmetry factor, was approximated to be 0.5 for all the electrochemical reactions. The exchange current, i0, is given byÂ i0 = k0[red]Î±[ox](1âˆ’Î±)(8)The governing mass transfer equations for all the species involved in the electrochemical reaction, including the supporting electrolyte cations and anions, isÂ (9)where Ci is the concentration of the species, Ri is the rate of reaction in which the species is involved and Ni is the flux, which is zero for all immobilized faradaic species: anthraquinone in its different oxidation and binding states, and ferrocene.

The current density can be obtained from the flux of charged mobile species in the electrolyteÂ (11)and the overall electroneutrality is maintained by ensuring thatÂ (12)The boundary conditions for these equations are ground (Î¦ = 0 V) for the anthraquinone electrode (colored grey in Fig. 9), and either constant current or constant potential at the ferrocene electrode (pink). The electrochemical model is the same for both sealed and flow systems, although the transport of CO2 in the gas phase (shown as a transparent block) is different in the two scenarios.\n",

      "In the sealed system, CO2 transport occurs via diffusion toward the electrode only, while in flow CO2 is also advected down the channel. In the sealed system, the partial pressure of the gas decreases during capture, while in flow the CO2 concentration changes along the gas channel with time, and the concentration of the gas leaving the device is a measure of the total effectiveness of the adsorption bed capacity and transport and kinetic limitations within the system. The total transport of CO2 is modelled by transport equations in each of the two phases, gas and IL. In the gas phase, the mass transfer governing equation in the sealed system is given byÂ (13)where CCO2,gas is the concentration of CO2 in the gas phase, obtained from its partial pressure and the ideal gas law. This governing equation has a no-flux boundary condition at the three wallsÂ (14)and at the gasâ€“IL interface, the fluxes normal to the interface are set to be equalÂ (15)where CCO2,IL is the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the IL phase. In the flow system, the flux of CO2 has an advective component as well and the governing equation becomesÂ (16)where u is the velocity of the gas flowing in the channel. The inlet is set at a constant concentration inflow and the outlet at zero gauge pressure. The mass transfer governing equation for dissolved CO2 in the IL phase, for both sealed and flow systems, is given byÂ (17)where R is a bulk reaction term describing the rate of the chemical reactions shown in Scheme 2(a). Simple rate equations, first order in all reactants, are used. A no-flux boundary condition is set at the walls. At the gasâ€“electrode interface, the concentration of dissolved CO2 is set toÂ CCO2,IL = Î²CCO2,gas(18)where Î² is the adjusted Henry's constant which accounts for the equilibrium partition of CO2 between the gas and IL phases.\n",

      "The simulation of constant-current charging at 0â€“5% CO2 concentrations in the sealed system in which the gas channel shown in Fig. 9 served as a gas headspace, shows results that are consistent with the aforementioned mechanism of CO2 capture. In addition to the cell voltage, the concentrations of all the cathode quinonic species were studied during the charging process. Fig. 10 shows the cell voltages at 0â€“5% CO2 and the concentration profiles of cathode species at 0, 2, and 5% CO2. The cell voltage profiles in Fig. 10(a) show that as the concentration of CO2 increases, less of the cell charging occurs at the higher potential. At 0% CO2 the cell simply traverses both reduction potentials of the quinone, and the species profiles in Fig. 10(b) show two consecutive conversions; the first is the reduction of quinone to semiquinone, and the second is the reduction of semiquinone to quinol dianion. The second reaction starts only after all the quinone is converted to semiquinone, and to further accommodate the incoming electrons at the constant current, the second, more energetic reduction takes place until all faradaic reactions are exhausted. Here, the simulation was stopped just short of full conversion to avoid numerical complications that arise from the exhaustion of faradaic material, i.e. complete charging. At 2% CO2, upon generation of the semiquinone, shown in Fig. 10(c), the modest diffusive flux of CO2 allows for the formation of the semiquinone monoadduct which soon accepts a second electron at the first reduction potential of quinone, hence extending the cell charging period spent at the lower potential. This dianion monoadduct can then react with a second CO2 molecule, to form the dianion diadduct. But, upon the depletion of CO2 in the vicinity of the cathode, due to a charging rate that is faster than the diffusive flux of CO2 into the electrolyte at 2% headspace concentration, the semiquinone is converted to the dianion at the higher second potential, while the concentrations of the dianion monoadduct and the dianion diadduct remain constant. This is reflected in the potential profile at 2% CO2 in Fig. 10(a). However, at 5% CO2, the diffusive flux of CO2 is adequate, and barely any semiquinone can be detected since it is converted to semiquinone monoadduct, and other subsequent species, soon after generation, shown in Fig. 10(d). Here, all the electrochemical reactions take place at the first potential and none of the semiquinone is converted to quinol dianion.\n",

      "Hence, the optimum charging method of the cell, i.e. CO2 capture, is to operate at a constant potential just larger than the first potential window Î”V1. The greater the charging voltage, the faster the reduction reaction due to the larger overpotential. For practical reasons, and to avoid large current surges, the cell can be charged at a constant current until the desired charging potential difference is reached. This will be between Î”V1 and Î”V2 based on the rate of charging desired. At this point the bed is activated for capture by making half the total capture capacity available. Then the cell can be set at that constant potential until saturation of the cathodes is achieved. The second half of the capture capacity is made available as more CO2 flows in.\n",
      "It is also possible to fully activate the bed by charging at a potential difference Î”VHigh > Î”V1, at which point the cells are disconnected and allowed to saturate with no further supply of current, until breakthrough is achieved, and the bed is regenerated by discharging the cell and releasing pure CO2. The energy recovered however, cannot exceed QÎ”V1, resulting in an energy loss of greater than Q(Î”VHigh âˆ’ Î”V1).\n",
      "Model results for flow system.\n",
      "The model described above was also used to simulate the capture of CO2 from a channel under flow conditions. The gas flowed parallel to the electrodes in the cell, a cross-section of which is shown in Fig. 9. The simulated concentration profiles in the channel and the quinone electrode are shown as a function of the number of bed volumes in Fig. 11(a). The gas phase profiles are consistent with a dispersed plug flow in the channels, with a reasonably sharp adsorption front, while the linear CO2 profiles in the electrode are a result of the significant diffusional limitations in this region. Of particular interest is the depletion of unbound quinonic species in the cathode as removal of CO2 from the channel proceeds; as the cathode becomes saturated with CO2, the concentration of CO2 increases along the length of the channel until breakthrough is achieved at around 8 bed volumes, after which further saturation is allowed until the outlet concentration is equal to the inlet concentration at around 10 bed volumes. Fig. 11(b) and (c) show the breakthrough profiles as a function of cell voltage for a given feed concentration, and of feed concentration for a given cell voltage, respectively. The number of bed volumes required increases with decreasing feed concentrations, a result of the fixed overall bed capacity and the rectangular nature of the adsorption isotherm of this system. In the absence of transport and reaction limitations, all breakthrough curves should collapse when the bed volume is multiplied by the feed fraction of the adsorbate; the fact that this is not exactly so in Fig. 11(d) indicates that mass transfer limitations do play a role in the uptake of CO2 by the activated electrodes. Nevertheless, the overall capacity, indicated by the trapezoidal area under Cout/Cin = 1 and the breakthrough curves, remained constant. However, the effect of a stronger driving force on improved mass transfer is evident in Fig. 11(b), where at charging potentials that are closer to Î”V2, more of the dianion is generated in a Nernstian distribution, which provides two reaction sites for CO2. This results in a stronger driving force in the adsorption of CO2 and hence improved mass transfer, which yields a sharper breakthrough profile.\n",

      "Fig. 11(e) and (f) show the current across the electrochemical cell during the capture experiments in (c) and (b) respectively. Fig. 11(e) shows that at low potential charging, i.e. 1.3 V, an initial spike in current is observed which results from the reduction of the quinones on the electrodes to semiquinone, as explained earlier. This is followed by a region of constant current which is proportional to the flux of CO2 into the electrodes, since it reacts with the semiquinones and allows them to accept a second electron at the low potential. As the electrodes become saturated and all the semiquinone is depleted, the current decreases. This region of constant current followed by the sharp decrease is very broad for the 10% case, but much shorter for the 50% case, where there is a brief transition from the initial spike to the decreasing current region manifested in a shoulder. However, Fig. 11(f) shows that as the applied capture potential increases, the current profile for the same inlet concentration changes dramatically. This is elucidated in Scheme 3; as the applied potential approaches Î”V2, all of the quinone is reduced to semiquinone and a Nernstian distribution of semiquinone and quinol dianion is generated, evident by the increasing current in the first peak.\n",
      "Scheme 3\n",
      "The reduction of anthraquinone at a potential higher than its second reduction potential with a limited flux of CO2.\n",
      "Thus, CO2 reacts with the Nernstian mixture of semiquinone and quinol dianion, where in the case of the latter no further reaction, chemical or electrochemical, occurs, but in the case of the former a semiquinone monoadduct species is formed, which can be reduced to the dianion monoadduct at Î”V1. Therefore, the applied potential presents a large overpotential for this reaction, hence the second increase in the current which corresponds to the electron transfer for this reduction. Following these steps, all the quinone moieties in the electrodes are in their doubly charged states and no further electron transfer occurs. This double peak behavior of the current is the result of the balance between the rate of electron transfer and the flux of CO2, which relates to the earlier discussions. At charging potentials higher than Î”V2e.g. Î”VHigh, not shown here, a larger first peak is expected where all the quinone is converted to semiquinone then dianion, i.e. two consecutive single-electron reductions, after which the current drops to zero and only chemical addition reactions occur, Scheme 2(b).\n",
      "Energetic analysis of CO2 release\n",
      "The applied release potential determines the energy recovered from the cell upon the release of CO2, and must, therefore, be selected carefully. While quinones under N2 are expected to be reduced and oxidized reversibly without any significant loss of energy, in an electrophile-rich environment, such as CO2, the reduction is only quasi-reversible due to the energetic penalty of breaking a bond formed with CO2. Therefore, some of the energy is lost in the process, and it is imperative to minimize this loss, since it is directly related to energy per mole of CO2 concentrated (captured and released) in a CO2 capture process. The last step in the CO2 capture, Scheme 1(b), i.e. the addition of a second molecule of CO2 to the semiquinone monoadduct to form a dianion diadduct, is chemically irreversible for the duration of the cycle,37 and the release reaction takes place via an electrochemical oxidation of the diadduct. This oxidation occurs at a more positive potential than the first reduction potential E01. Thus, the more positive the release potential, the larger the overpotential and the faster and more complete is the release of the bound CO2. However, a more positive release voltage corresponds to less energy recovered during discharge, and thus more work done per cycle of capture and release, which is given by eqn (2).\n",
      "Consequently, to reduce energy losses per cycle, a less positive potential can be used in a constant potential discharge. While the capture cell voltage can be maintained at fairly minimal levels by setting it close to Î”V1, with some diminishment in rate, release at high cell voltages can result in a partial release of CO2, due to the partial oxidation of the bis(carbonate) quinone units (dianion diadduct units), and a subsequent underutilization of anthraquinone. After a few cycles of capture and release at a higher potential, a constant equilibrium rate of utilization of anthraquinone is achieved. This is akin to the working capacity of a pressure-swing adsorption system.45 Thus partial release can be achieved at higher cell discharge potentials as shown in Fig. 12. This allows for a much smaller window of operation, which at the âˆ¼90% faradaic efficiency reported earlier, an energy use of âˆ¼43 kJ molâˆ’1, with 60% utilization of accessible quinone is possible. This is on par with other carbon capture systems in efficiency and energy consumption,46,47 including thermal swing systems.48\n",
      "Fig. 12\n",
      "Fraction of CO2 released from the PAQâ€“CNT electrode with release voltage. At a constant capture cell voltage of 1.3 V, less of the bed is recovered with increasing release cell voltage, but the energy per mole of CO2 captured and released also decreases.\n",
      "Solid sorbent materials used in carbon capture applications have enthalpies of CO2 adsorption of the same order, e.g., Metalâ€“Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with 30â€“50 kJ molâˆ’1 for some types of MOF-74,49 and âˆ¼100 kJ molâˆ’1 for some amine functionalized MOFs,50 or zeolites, such as 13X at 40 kJ molâˆ’1.51 However, these are not process energetics but rather enthalpies of adsorption. Therefore, processes which are designed to utilize these materials incur greater energetic penalties associated with the techniques used for delivering the energy for desorption, i.e. heat and pressure change, whereas the energetics reported herein correspond to that of the process, which unlike those utilizing solid sorbents, has a binary affinity for CO2.\n",
      "Moreover, if a precise rate of release is desired, the cell can be discharged at a constant current. In this case, the flux of the released CO2 is proportional to the current density, as given by eqn (3). The discharge current and time, control the charge transferred, which is the extensive variable in the work of the process. This method of release is seldom utilized in swing adsorption processes, because it is the intensive, rather than the extensive variable, that is modulated, e.g., temperature in thermal swing, pressure in pressure swing, and, here, potential. Nevertheless, this can be useful for fast regeneration of the bed at high currents, where long periods of capture and short periods of release are desired. But due to the incomplete discharge of the electrochemical cells, in analogy with high current discharge of batteries,30 the bed will only be partially regenerated.\n",
      "Swing operations\n",
      "The electro-swing adsorption (ESA) technology developed in this work has a number of perceived advantages over other swing technologies such as temperature- (TSA) and pressure-swing (PSA) adsorption in terms of both its mode of operation and its thermodynamic adsorption characteristics, as illustrated in Fig. 13. Temperature-swing operations require heating and cooling of the entire adsorption matrix to release the adsorbed compounds, rather than just targeting the adsorption sites themselves, which introduces many thermal inefficiencies to the operation. The heating is typically accomplished with high-temperature steam as the sweep gas, with subsequent condensation of the steam to recover the pure CO2 product stream, whereas cooling is achieved during the blowdown phase in preparation for the next sorption cycle. With pressure-swing operations, the release of the captured material occurs on reduction of the adsorbate partial pressure in the sweep to reverse the mass transfer driving force, which can be achieved either by drawing a vacuum on the bed, or by using low pressure steam as the sweep gas. The product leaving the bed is dilute, and requires a second separation step, such as the condensation of steam, and external compression of the resulting CO2 to bring it to the desired pressures for subsequent utilization or for transportation and subsurface sequestration in geologic formations. Moreover, in both TSA and PSA operations, the working capacity is strongly dependent on the shape of the Langmuir- (or Freundlich-) type isotherm, with significantly lower capacities at lower concentrations, which limits the degree of regeneration of the adsorbent, or the partial pressure of the recovered adsorbate in the sweep stream. The electro-swing adsorbents, on the other hand, are characterized by a rectangular adsorption isotherm in which the saturation loading capacity in the activated state is independent of the gas phase concentration, so the adsorbent is equally effective over a wide range of feed concentrations from ambient conditions through to those characteristic of large scale power and industrial facilities. When deactivated, the adsorbent has negligible capacity for the CO2 even at high CO2 gas phase concentrations such that the working capacity of the adsorbent is independent of operating conditions. Thus, the sweep stream during the desorption process can be pure CO2 at the desired pressure, subject primarily to equipment design constraints, which greatly simplifies the adsorption/desorption cycle relative to those of the TSA and PSA processes. The results in Fig. 6(a) show that release into a pure CO2 gas environment is facile and fast, and complete if sufficient time is allowed to account for the kinetics of the process.\n",

      "Conclusions\n",
      "The electro-swing operations outlined in this paper offer a new approach to the exploitation of electrochemically mediated complexation of CO2 with redox-active species for the mitigation of CO2 emissions, and for control of CO2 levels in confined environments. Electro-swing adsorption has been shown to be equally effective, at a constant capacity, for the capture of CO2 at concentrations typical of fossil fuel combustion flue gases (âˆ¼10%) and in confined ambient environments (0.6â€“0.8%). These advances have been made possible by the development of new electrode materials in which redox-active moieties, such as quinones, that can bind CO2 in one oxidation state but not in another are immobilized onto the electrode substrates. These functionalized electrodes were incorporated into an electrochemical cell assembly to facilitate their cyclical electrochemical reduction and oxidation. The cells demonstrated exceptional capture and release of CO2 over more than 7000 cycles at 60â€“70% quinone utilization, 90% faradaic efficiency, and 90 kJ molâˆ’1 at 100% bed utilization and 43 kJ molâˆ’1 at 60%. A significant advantage of the quinone-functionalized electrodes is that they have a CO2 capacity that is essentially independent of the inlet feed concentration, in contrast to the capacities of sorbents typically used in PSA or TSA operations, where Langmuir-type equilibria limit capacity at lower concentrations.\n",
      "The strong performance of the electro-swing process allows for numerous applications where CO2 removal and/or storage is of interest. The ESA device can be easily integrated into processes in a plug-and-play fashion due to its simple design, and minimum requirement for ancillary equipment, primarily a regulated power source and sink (load). An initial techno-economic analysis (not reported here) shows that such carbon capture systems can be economically feasible with costs ranging from $50â€“$100 per tonne CO2 depending on the feed concentrations and applications under consideration.\n",
      "It is projected that further optimization of the ESA process can be obtained through refinement of the electrode chemistries and their assembly into compact adsorption devices to address a wide range of CO2 mitigation strategies.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Limited capacity: The system has a limited capacity for CO2 capture, as indicated by the rectangular adsorption isotherm. This limits the degree of regeneration of the adsorbent and the partial pressure of the recovered CO2 in the sweep stream.\n",
      "\n",

      "3. Energy losses during release: The release of CO2 from the system incurs energy losses due to the quasi-reversible nature of the reduction reaction in an electrophile-rich environment like CO2.

      "\n",
      "4. Partial release at high discharge potentials: High discharge potentials can result in partial release of CO2 due to the partial oxidation of the bis(carbonate) quinone units. This can lead to underutilization of anthraquinone and incomplete regeneration of the adsorption bed.\n",

While the first of the two electrochemical reactions in Scheme 2(b) is the same as that of Scheme 2(a), the second reaction has Q2âˆ’ as the reduced species and QË™âˆ’ as the species with higher oxidation number, with a standard reduction potential of E02. Likewise, in the anode oxidation reaction, Fc+ (ferrocenium) is the oxidized species and Fc (ferrocene) is the reduced species at E0 = âˆ’0.03 V. The current densities of these reactions were described by the Butlerâ€“Volmer equation,Â (7)where Î· is the overpotential and Î±, the symmetry factor, was approximated to be 0.5 for all the electrochemical reactions. The exchange current, i0, is given byÂ i0 = k0[red]Î±[ox](1âˆ’Î±)(8)The governing mass transfer equations for all the species involved in the electrochemical reaction, including the supporting electrolyte cations and anions, isÂ (9)where Ci is the concentration of the species, Ri is the rate of reaction in which the species is involved and Ni is the flux, which is zero for all immobilized faradaic species: anthraquinone in its different oxidation and binding states, and ferrocene. For mobile species, mainly the supporting electrolyte ions, the flux is given byÂ Ni = âˆ’Diâˆ‡Ci âˆ’ ziuiFCiâˆ‡Î¦(10)where zi is the valence, ui is the molar mobility, F is Faraday's constant and Î¦ is the electric potential. The current density can be obtained from the flux of charged mobile species in the electrolyteÂ (11)and the overall electroneutrality is maintained by ensuring thatÂ (12)The boundary conditions for these equations are ground (Î¦ = 0 V) for the anthraquinone electrode (colored grey in Fig. 9), and either constant current or constant potential at the ferrocene electrode (pink). The electrochemical model is the same for both sealed and flow systems, although the transport of CO2 in the gas phase (shown as a transparent block) is different in the two scenarios.\n",

      "In the sealed system, CO2 transport occurs via diffusion toward the electrode only, while in flow CO2 is also advected down the channel. In the sealed system, the partial pressure of the gas decreases during capture, while in flow the CO2 concentration changes along the gas channel with time, and the concentration of the gas leaving the device is a measure of the total effectiveness of the adsorption bed capacity and transport and kinetic limitations within the system. The total transport of CO2 is modelled by transport equations in each of the two phases, gas and IL. In the gas phase, the mass transfer governing equation in the sealed system is given byÂ (13)where CCO2,gas is the concentration of CO2 in the gas phase, obtained from its partial pressure and the ideal gas law. This governing equation has a no-flux boundary condition at the three wallsÂ (14)and at the gasâ€“IL interface, the fluxes normal to the interface are set to be equalÂ (15)where CCO2,IL is the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the IL phase. In the flow system, the flux of CO2 has an advective component as well and the governing equation becomesÂ (16)where u is the velocity of the gas flowing in the channel. The inlet is set at a constant concentration inflow and the outlet at zero gauge pressure. The mass transfer governing equation for dissolved CO2 in the IL phase, for both sealed and flow systems, is given byÂ (17)where R is a bulk reaction term describing the rate of the chemical reactions shown in Scheme 2(a). Simple rate equations, first order in all reactants, are used. A no-flux boundary condition is set at the walls. At the gasâ€“electrode interface, the concentration of dissolved CO2 is set toÂ CCO2,IL = Î²CCO2,gas(18)where Î² is the adjusted Henry's constant which accounts for the equilibrium partition of CO2 between the gas and IL phases.\n",

      "The simulation of constant-current charging at 0â€“5% CO2 concentrations in the sealed system in which the gas channel shown in Fig. 9 served as a gas headspace, shows results that are consistent with the aforementioned mechanism of CO2 capture. In addition to the cell voltage, the concentrations of all the cathode quinonic species were studied during the charging process. Fig. 10 shows the cell voltages at 0â€“5% CO2 and the concentration profiles of cathode species at 0, 2, and 5% CO2. The cell voltage profiles in Fig. 10(a) show that as the concentration of CO2 increases, less of the cell charging occurs at the higher potential. At 0% CO2 the cell simply traverses both reduction potentials of the quinone, and the species profiles in Fig. 10(b) show two consecutive conversions; the first is the reduction of quinone to semiquinone, and the second is the reduction of semiquinone to quinol dianion. The second reaction starts only after all the quinone is converted to semiquinone, and to further accommodate the incoming electrons at the constant current, the second, more energetic reduction takes place until all faradaic reactions are exhausted. Here, the simulation was stopped just short of full conversion to avoid numerical complications that arise from the exhaustion of faradaic material, i.e. complete charging. At 2% CO2, upon generation of the semiquinone, shown in Fig. 10(c), the modest diffusive flux of CO2 allows for the formation of the semiquinone monoadduct which soon accepts a second electron at the first reduction potential of quinone, hence extending the cell charging period spent at the lower potential. This dianion monoadduct can then react with a second CO2 molecule, to form the dianion diadduct. But, upon the depletion of CO2 in the vicinity of the cathode, due to a charging rate that is faster than the diffusive flux of CO2 into the electrolyte at 2% headspace concentration, the semiquinone is converted to the dianion at the higher second potential, while the concentrations of the dianion monoadduct and the dianion diadduct remain constant. This is reflected in the potential profile at 2% CO2 in Fig. 10(a). However, at 5% CO2, the diffusive flux of CO2 is adequate, and barely any semiquinone can be detected since it is converted to semiquinone monoadduct, and other subsequent species, soon after generation, shown in Fig. 10(d). Here, all the electrochemical reactions take place at the first potential and none of the semiquinone is converted to quinol dianion.\n",

      "Simulation of charging the electrochemical cell at different CO2 concentrations at constant current. (a) Potential difference of the cell. The change in concentration of quinone with charge is shown at (b) 0%, (c) 2% and (d) 5% CO2.\n",
      "Hence, the optimum charging method of the cell, i.e. CO2 capture, is to operate at a constant potential just larger than the first potential window Î”V1. The greater the charging voltage, the faster the reduction reaction due to the larger overpotential. For practical reasons, and to avoid large current surges, the cell can be charged at a constant current until the desired charging potential difference is reached. This will be between Î”V1 and Î”V2 based on the rate of charging desired. At this point the bed is activated for capture by making half the total capture capacity available. Then the cell can be set at that constant potential until saturation of the cathodes is achieved. The second half of the capture capacity is made available as more CO2 flows in.\n",
      "It is also possible to fully activate the bed by charging at a potential difference Î”VHigh > Î”V1, at which point the cells are disconnected and allowed to saturate with no further supply of current, until breakthrough is achieved, and the bed is regenerated by discharging the cell and releasing pure CO2. The energy recovered however, cannot exceed QÎ”V1, resulting in an energy loss of greater than Q(Î”VHigh âˆ’ Î”V1).\n",
      "Model results for flow system.\n",
      "The model described above was also used to simulate the capture of CO2 from a channel under flow conditions. The gas flowed parallel to the electrodes in the cell, a cross-section of which is shown in Fig. 9. The simulated concentration profiles in the channel and the quinone electrode are shown as a function of the number of bed volumes in Fig. 11(a). The gas phase profiles are consistent with a dispersed plug flow in the channels, with a reasonably sharp adsorption front, while the linear CO2 profiles in the electrode are a result of the significant diffusional limitations in this region. Of particular interest is the depletion of unbound quinonic species in the cathode as removal of CO2 from the channel proceeds; as the cathode becomes saturated with CO2, the concentration of CO2 increases along the length of the channel until breakthrough is achieved at around 8 bed volumes, after which further saturation is allowed until the outlet concentration is equal to the inlet concentration at around 10 bed volumes. Fig. 11(b) and (c) show the breakthrough profiles as a function of cell voltage for a given feed concentration, and of feed concentration for a given cell voltage, respectively. The number of bed volumes required increases with decreasing feed concentrations, a result of the fixed overall bed capacity and the rectangular nature of the adsorption isotherm of this system. In the absence of transport and reaction limitations, all breakthrough curves should collapse when the bed volume is multiplied by the feed fraction of the adsorbate; the fact that this is not exactly so in Fig. 11(d) indicates that mass transfer limitations do play a role in the uptake of CO2 by the activated electrodes. Nevertheless, the overall capacity, indicated by the trapezoidal area under Cout/Cin = 1 and the breakthrough curves, remained constant. However, the effect of a stronger driving force on improved mass transfer is evident in Fig. 11(b), where at charging potentials that are closer to Î”V2, more of the dianion is generated in a Nernstian distribution, which provides two reaction sites for CO2. This results in a stronger driving force in the adsorption of CO2 and hence improved mass transfer, which yields a sharper breakthrough profile.\n",

(d) Normalized breakthrough profiles of the capture experiments in (c). (e) The current across the electrochemical cells during the capture experiments in (b). (f) The current across the electrochemical cells during the capture experiments in (c).\n",
      "Fig. 11(e) and (f) show the current across the electrochemical cell during the capture experiments in (c) and (b) respectively. Fig. 11(e) shows that at low potential charging, i.e. 1.3 V, an initial spike in current is observed which results from the reduction of the quinones on the electrodes to semiquinone, as explained earlier. This is followed by a region of constant current which is proportional to the flux of CO2 into the electrodes, since it reacts with the semiquinones and allows them to accept a second electron at the low potential. As the electrodes become saturated and all the semiquinone is depleted, the current decreases. This region of constant current followed by the sharp decrease is very broad for the 10% case, but much shorter for the 50% case, where there is a brief transition from the initial spike to the decreasing current region manifested in a shoulder. However, Fig. 11(f) shows that as the applied capture potential increases, the current profile for the same inlet concentration changes dramatically. This is elucidated in Scheme 3; as the applied potential approaches Î”V2, all of the quinone is reduced to semiquinone and a Nernstian distribution of semiquinone and quinol dianion is generated, evident by the increasing current in the first peak.\n",
      "Scheme 3\n",
      "The reduction of anthraquinone at a potential higher than its second reduction potential with a limited flux of CO2.\n",
      "Thus, CO2 reacts with the Nernstian mixture of semiquinone and quinol dianion, where in the case of the latter no further reaction, chemical or electrochemical, occurs, but in the case of the former a semiquinone monoadduct species is formed, which can be reduced to the dianion monoadduct at Î”V1. Therefore, the applied potential presents a large overpotential for this reaction, hence the second increase in the current which corresponds to the electron transfer for this reduction. Following these steps, all the quinone moieties in the electrodes are in their doubly charged states and no further electron transfer occurs. This double peak behavior of the current is the result of the balance between the rate of electron transfer and the flux of CO2, which relates to the earlier discussions. At charging potentials higher than Î”V2e.g. Î”VHigh, not shown here, a larger first peak is expected where all the quinone is converted to semiquinone then dianion, i.e. two consecutive single-electron reductions, after which the current drops to zero and only chemical addition reactions occur, Scheme 2(b).\n",
      "Energetic analysis of CO2 release\n",
      "The applied release potential determines the energy recovered from the cell upon the release of CO2, and must, therefore, be selected carefully. While quinones under N2 are expected to be reduced and oxidized reversibly without any significant loss of energy, in an electrophile-rich environment, such as CO2, the reduction is only quasi-reversible due to the energetic penalty of breaking a bond formed with CO2. Therefore, some of the energy is lost in the process, and it is imperative to minimize this loss, since it is directly related to energy per mole of CO2 concentrated (captured and released) in a CO2 capture process. The last step in the CO2 capture, Scheme 1(b), i.e. the addition of a second molecule of CO2 to the semiquinone monoadduct to form a dianion diadduct, is chemically irreversible for the duration of the cycle,37 and the release reaction takes place via an electrochemical oxidation of the diadduct. This oxidation occurs at a more positive potential than the first reduction potential E01. Thus, the more positive the release potential, the larger the overpotential and the faster and more complete is the release of the bound CO2. However, a more positive release voltage corresponds to less energy recovered during discharge, and thus more work done per cycle of capture and release, which is given by eqn (2).\n",
      "Consequently, to reduce energy losses per cycle, a less positive potential can be used in a constant potential discharge. While the capture cell voltage can be maintained at fairly minimal levels by setting it close to Î”V1, with some diminishment in rate, release at high cell voltages can result in a partial release of CO2, due to the partial oxidation of the bis(carbonate) quinone units (dianion diadduct units), and a subsequent underutilization of anthraquinone. After a few cycles of capture and release at a higher potential, a constant equilibrium rate of utilization of anthraquinone is achieved. This is akin to the working capacity of a pressure-swing adsorption system.45 Thus partial release can be achieved at higher cell discharge potentials as shown in Fig. 12. This allows for a much smaller window of operation, which at the âˆ¼90% faradaic efficiency reported earlier, an energy use of âˆ¼43 kJ molâˆ’1, with 60% utilization of accessible quinone is possible. This is on par with other carbon capture systems in efficiency and energy consumption,46,47 including thermal swing systems.48\n",
      "Fig. 12\n",
      "Fraction of CO2 released from the PAQâ€“CNT electrode with release voltage. At a constant capture cell voltage of 1.3 V, less of the bed is recovered with increasing release cell voltage, but the energy per mole of CO2 captured and released also decreases.\n",
      "Solid sorbent materials used in carbon capture applications have enthalpies of CO2 adsorption of the same order, e.g., Metalâ€“Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with 30â€“50 kJ molâˆ’1 for some types of MOF-74,49 and âˆ¼100 kJ molâˆ’1 for some amine functionalized MOFs,50 or zeolites, such as 13X at 40 kJ molâˆ’1.51 However, these are not process energetics but rather enthalpies of adsorption. Therefore, processes which are designed to utilize these materials incur greater energetic penalties associated with the techniques used for delivering the energy for desorption, i.e. heat and pressure change, whereas the energetics reported herein correspond to that of the process, which unlike those utilizing solid sorbents, has a binary affinity for CO2.\n",
      "Moreover, if a precise rate of release is desired, the cell can be discharged at a constant current. In this case, the flux of the released CO2 is proportional to the current density, as given by eqn (3). The discharge current and time, control the charge transferred, which is the extensive variable in the work of the process. This method of release is seldom utilized in swing adsorption processes, because it is the intensive, rather than the extensive variable, that is modulated, e.g., temperature in thermal swing, pressure in pressure swing, and, here, potential. Nevertheless, this can be useful for fast regeneration of the bed at high currents, where long periods of capture and short periods of release are desired. But due to the incomplete discharge of the electrochemical cells, in analogy with high current discharge of batteries,30 the bed will only be partially regenerated.\n",
      "Swing operations\n",
      "The electro-swing adsorption (ESA) technology developed in this work has a number of perceived advantages over other swing technologies such as temperature- (TSA) and pressure-swing (PSA) adsorption in terms of both its mode of operation and its thermodynamic adsorption characteristics, as illustrated in Fig. 13. Temperature-swing operations require heating and cooling of the entire adsorption matrix to release the adsorbed compounds, rather than just targeting the adsorption sites themselves, which introduces many thermal inefficiencies to the operation. The heating is typically accomplished with high-temperature steam as the sweep gas, with subsequent condensation of the steam to recover the pure CO2 product stream, whereas cooling is achieved during the blowdown phase in preparation for the next sorption cycle. With pressure-swing operations, the release of the captured material occurs on reduction of the adsorbate partial pressure in the sweep to reverse the mass transfer driving force, which can be achieved either by drawing a vacuum on the bed, or by using low pressure steam as the sweep gas. The product leaving the bed is dilute, and requires a second separation step, such as the condensation of steam, and external compression of the resulting CO2 to bring it to the desired pressures for subsequent utilization or for transportation and subsurface sequestration in geologic formations. Moreover, in both TSA and PSA operations, the working capacity is strongly dependent on the shape of the Langmuir- (or Freundlich-) type isotherm, with significantly lower capacities at lower concentrations, which limits the degree of regeneration of the adsorbent, or the partial pressure of the recovered adsorbate in the sweep stream. The electro-swing adsorbents, on the other hand, are characterized by a rectangular adsorption isotherm in which the saturation loading capacity in the activated state is independent of the gas phase concentration, so the adsorbent is equally effective over a wide range of feed concentrations from ambient conditions through to those characteristic of large scale power and industrial facilities. When deactivated, the adsorbent has negligible capacity for the CO2 even at high CO2 gas phase concentrations such that the working capacity of the adsorbent is independent of operating conditions. Thus, the sweep stream during the desorption process can be pure CO2 at the desired pressure, subject primarily to equipment design constraints, which greatly simplifies the adsorption/desorption cycle relative to those of the TSA and PSA processes. The results in Fig. 6(a) show that release into a pure CO2 gas environment is facile and fast, and complete if sufficient time is allowed to account for the kinetics of the process.\n",

      "Conclusions\n",
      "The electro-swing operations outlined in this paper offer a new approach to the exploitation of electrochemically mediated complexation of CO2 with redox-active species for the mitigation of CO2 emissions, and for control of CO2 levels in confined environments. Electro-swing adsorption has been shown to be equally effective, at a constant capacity, for the capture of CO2 at concentrations typical of fossil fuel combustion flue gases (âˆ¼10%) and in confined ambient environments (0.6â€“0.8%). These advances have been made possible by the development of new electrode materials in which redox-active moieties, such as quinones, that can bind CO2 in one oxidation state but not in another are immobilized onto the electrode substrates. These functionalized electrodes were incorporated into an electrochemical cell assembly to facilitate their cyclical electrochemical reduction and oxidation. The cells demonstrated exceptional capture and release of CO2 over more than 7000 cycles at 60â€“70% quinone utilization, 90% faradaic efficiency, and 90 kJ molâˆ’1 at 100% bed utilization and 43 kJ molâˆ’1 at 60%. A significant advantage of the quinone-functionalized electrodes is that they have a CO2 capacity that is essentially independent of the inlet feed concentration, in contrast to the capacities of sorbents typically used in PSA or TSA operations, where Langmuir-type equilibria limit capacity at lower concentrations.\n",
      "The strong performance of the electro-swing process allows for numerous applications where CO2 removal and/or storage is of interest. The ESA device can be easily integrated into processes in a plug-and-play fashion due to its simple design, and minimum requirement for ancillary equipment, primarily a regulated power source and sink (load). An initial techno-economic analysis (not reported here) shows that such carbon capture systems can be economically feasible with costs ranging from $50â€“$100 per tonne CO2 depending on the feed concentrations and applications under consideration.\n",
      "It is projected that further optimization of the ESA process can be obtained through refinement of the electrode chemistries and their assembly into compact adsorption devices to address a wide range of CO2 mitigation strategies.\n",

      "Carbon capture is one of the foremost methods for curtailing greenhouse gas emissions. Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\n",

      "Below include all the problems to prioritize:\n",
      "Prioritized list of problems based on biggest bottleneck to increasing the approach's carbon capture efficiency:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Mass transfer limitations: The transport of CO2 into the porous electrode is the rate-limiting step in the carbon capture process. This can result in slower capture rates and broader breakthrough profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Variation in channel width: Imperfect packing of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to variation in channel width, causing uneven distribution of flow and overlapping breakthrough profiles.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. Electrode degradation: Over time, the electrochemical cells may experience degradation, resulting in a loss of capacity. This can be due to electromigration of shorter polymer chains from the electrode and into the electrolyte.\n",

      "5. Energy requirements: The energy required for the capture and release of CO2 can vary depending on the flux of CO2 and the rate of reduction of the quinones. Lower CO2 fluxes can result in higher energy requirements.\n",

      "6. Channeling effects: Improper assembly of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to channeling, where some channels bypass the active cells. This can result in lower overall efficiency and incomplete capture of CO2.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Sensitivity to oxygen: The presence of oxygen in the feed stream can cause oxidation of the reduced quinones, reducing the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system. Careful tuning of the electron density of the quinone polymer is required to avoid reactions with oxygen.\n",

      "1. Mass transfer limitations: The transport of CO2 into the porous electrode is the rate-limiting step in the carbon capture process. This can result in slower capture rates and broader breakthrough profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Variation in channel width: Imperfect packing of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to variation in channel width, causing uneven distribution of flow and overlapping breakthrough profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Sluggish electron transfer: The CVs of the polyanthraquinone-carbon nanotube (PAQ-CNT) composite electrodes show sluggish electron transfer, which can affect the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Electrode degradation: Over time, the electrochemical cells may experience degradation, resulting in a loss of capacity. This can be due to electromigration of shorter polymer chains from the electrode and into the electrolyte.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Energy requirements: The energy required for the capture and release of CO2 can vary depending on the flux of CO2 and the rate of reduction of the quinones. Lower CO2 fluxes can result in higher energy requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Channeling effects: Improper assembly of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to channeling, where some channels bypass the active cells. This can result in lower overall efficiency and incomplete capture of CO2.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Sensitivity to oxygen: The presence of oxygen in the feed stream can cause oxidation of the reduced quinones, reducing the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system. Careful tuning of the electron density of the quinone polymer is required to avoid reactions with oxygen.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Complex flow systems: The electrochemical cell system eliminates the need for complex flow systems, but the assembly and design of the contactor bed can still be challenging and require careful optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Limited capacity: The capacity of the electrochemical cells and contactor bed is limited by the amount of quinone material and the overall size of the system. Scaling up the system may require additional optimization and engineering considerations.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Limited applicability: The electrochemical cell system may not be suitable for all carbon capture applications, as it is primarily designed for capturing CO2 from flue gas and other CO2-rich streams. Other carbon capture scenarios, such as removing CO2 from enclosed spaces or low concentration streams, may require different approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Limited capacity: The system has a limited capacity for CO2 capture, as indicated by the rectangular adsorption isotherm. This limits the degree of regeneration of the adsorbent and the partial pressure of the recovered CO2 in the sweep stream.\n",

      "13. Energy losses during release: The release of CO2 from the system incurs energy losses due to the quasi-reversible nature of the reduction reaction in an electrophile-rich environment like CO2. The more positive the release potential, the larger the overpotential and the faster the release, but the less energy is recovered during discharge.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Partial release at high discharge potentials: High discharge potentials can result in partial release of CO2 due to the partial oxidation of the bis(carbonate) quinone units. This can lead to underutilization of anthraquinone and incomplete regeneration of the adsorption bed.\n",
      "\n",

      "17. Durability concerns: The durability of the electrochemical cells used in the system is reported to show <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cycles. While this is promising, further studies are needed to assess the long-term durability and stability of the cells under various operating conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "18. Energy consumption: The reported energy use for the system ranges from 43 to 90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, depending on the bed utilization and release potential. While this is on par with other carbon capture systems, further optimization is needed to reduce energy consumption and make the system more efficient.\n",
      "\n",

Techno-economic feasibility: While an initial techno-economic analysis suggests that the carbon capture system can be economically feasible with costs ranging from $50-$100 per tonne of CO2, further analysis and optimization are needed to assess the economic viability of the system for different applications and feed concentrations.\n",

    "Carbon capture is one of the foremost methods for curtailing greenhouse gas emissions. Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\n",

      "['1. Mass transfer limitations: The transport of CO2 into the porous electrode is the rate-limiting step in the carbon capture process. This can result in slower capture rates and broader breakthrough profiles.', '2. Variation in channel width: Imperfect packing of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to variation in channel width, causing uneven distribution of flow and overlapping breakthrough profiles.', '3. Sluggish electron transfer: The CVs of the polyanthraquinone-carbon nanotube (PAQ-CNT) composite electrodes show sluggish electron transfer, which can affect the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system.', '4. Electrode degradation: Over time, the electrochemical cells may experience degradation, resulting in a loss of capacity. This can be due to electromigration of shorter polymer chains from the electrode and into the electrolyte.', '5. Energy requirements: The energy required for the capture and release of CO2 can vary depending on the flux of CO2 and the rate of reduction of the quinones. Lower CO2 fluxes can result in higher energy requirements.', '6. Channeling effects: Improper assembly of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to channeling, where some channels bypass the active cells. This can result in lower overall efficiency and incomplete capture of CO2.', '7. Sensitivity to oxygen: The presence of oxygen in the feed stream can cause oxidation of the reduced quinones, reducing the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system. Careful tuning of the electron density of the quinone polymer is required to avoid reactions with oxygen.', '8. Complex flow systems: The electrochemical cell system eliminates the need for complex flow systems, but the assembly and design of the contactor bed can still be challenging and require careful optimization.', '9. Limited capacity: The capacity of the electrochemical cells and contactor bed is limited by the amount of quinone material and the overall size of the system. Scaling up the system may require additional optimization and engineering considerations.', '10. Limited applicability: The electrochemical cell system may not be suitable for all carbon capture applications, as it is primarily designed for capturing CO2 from flue gas and other CO2-rich streams. Other carbon capture scenarios, such as removing CO2 from enclosed spaces or low concentration streams, may require different approaches.', '11. Limited capacity: The system has a limited capacity for CO2 capture, as indicated by the rectangular adsorption isotherm. This limits the degree of regeneration of the adsorbent and the partial pressure of the recovered CO2 in the sweep stream.', '12. Mass transfer limitations: The system may experience mass transfer limitations, as indicated by the breakthrough profiles in flow system experiments. This can affect the uptake of CO2 by the activated electrodes.', '13. Energy losses during release: The release of CO2 from the system incurs energy losses due to the quasi-reversible nature of the reduction reaction in an electrophile-rich environment like CO2. The more positive the release potential, the larger the overpotential and the faster the release, but the less energy is recovered during discharge.', '14. Partial release at high discharge potentials: High discharge potentials can result in partial release of CO2 due to the partial oxidation of the bis(carbonate) quinone units. This can lead to underutilization of anthraquinone and incomplete regeneration of the adsorption bed.', '15. Complex electrode chemistries: The electrode materials used in the system, such as poly(1,4-anthraquinone) and poly(vinylferrocene), may have complex synthesis and preparation processes, which can add complexity to the overall system.', '16. Limited faradaic efficiency: Although the system demonstrates a faradaic efficiency of >90%, there is still room for improvement in terms of increasing the efficiency of the electrochemical reactions involved in CO2 capture and release.', '17. Durability concerns: The durability of the electrochemical cells used in the system is reported to show <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cycles. While this is promising, further studies are needed to assess the long-term durability and stability of the cells under various operating conditions.', '18. Energy consumption: The reported energy use for the system ranges from 43 to 90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, depending on the bed utilization and release potential. While this is on par with other carbon capture systems, further optimization is needed to reduce energy consumption and make the system more efficient.', '19. Techno-economic feasibility: While an initial techno-economic analysis suggests that the carbon capture system can be economically feasible with costs ranging from $50-$100 per tonne of CO2, further analysis and optimization are needed to assess the economic viability of the system for different applications and feed concentrations.']\n"

      "cations to the plant. Consequently, there has been a major effort to develop new materials and processes for high efficiency CO2-capture, including sorbents for pressure and temperature swing adsorption systems,7 and membranes for selective transport of the CO2.8 Furthermore, many potential applications of carbon capture require compact devices due to space limitations, such as in the direct capture of CO2 from tailpipe exhausts on board mobile sources, in which there is growing interest given the large contribution of transportation exhaust to greenhouse gas emissions (33.5% of U.S. CO2 emissions in 2016).9\n",
      "In addition to the capture of CO2 from direct combustion processes, there is a need to remove CO2 from enclosed spaces for ventilation purposes in buildings and car cabins, or for cabin environmental control systems on board spacecraft and submarines, where the maximum allowed CO2 concentration in habitable spaces is 5000 ppm (or 0.5%).10 The first of such systems was developed by Winnick et al., for the electrochemical capture of CO2 in spacecraft cabins using molten carbonates.11 However, the low concentration of CO2 in such applications poses a challenge, mainly due to the low driving forces for mass transfer and the large quantities of other species present in air in addition to CO2.12 Thus, carbon capture is a multi-scale problem, where the CO2-rich streams to be treated vary greatly in volume, concentration and composition, and different criteria need to be fulfilled to ensure optimal processing depending on whether sources are industrial or small-scale (e.g., power plants or oil and gas heaters), concentrated or dilute (exhausts from combustion or air in confined spaces), and clean or contaminated with other pollutants.\n",
      "Many of the CO2-capture chemical processes that involve a capture agent such as amines or solid sorbents require temperature and/or pressure swings to release the captured CO2 and regenerate the agents for further capture. These swings result in inefficiencies due to energy wasted in heating solvents and sorbents, pressurizing feed gas, or drawing a vacuum for desorption. Electrochemical systems can minimize such parasitic energy losses as they can be operated at near isothermal conditions, with significantly higher efficiencies than their thermal-swing (TSA) and pressure-swing (PSA) adsorption counterparts.13 One mode of electrochemical capture of CO2 is through the use of a redox-active carrier.\n",
      "Electrochemically mediated selective transport of chemical species was first reported by Ward et al.,14 where a redox-active carrier (ferrous ion) was used to transport nitric oxide across a membrane. Since then, a number of systems have been developed for transporting chemical species by redox-active carriers that are activated at one electrode, to bind with the target species, and deactivated at the opposite electrode, to release the target and regenerate the carrier.15,16 Systems that have been proposed for the concentration of CO2 through this approach have been based on a number of different carrier molecules, such as quinones,17–20 4,4′-bipyridine,21 and thiolates.22,23 Quinones are of particular interest to this work for their superior electrochemical performance, serving as redox-active carriers for CO2 in electrochemically mediated separation processes. DuBois et al. demonstrated this possibility, and studied the thermodynamics of an electrochemical CO2 pumping system that utilizes quinones.18 More work followed, where Scovazzo et al. demonstrated the electrochemical separation of CO2 from <1% concentration gas mixtures using 2,6-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone as a carrier in ionic liquid (IL) and organic solvent electrolytes media,19 while Gurkan et al. screened a number of ILs to serve as suitable electrolytes for quinone carriers in an electrochemically mediated selective transport system for CO2.20 All of these systems, however, require the transport of the electrolyte and the dissolved carrier\n",

Non-woven carbon fiber mat electrode substrates of thickness 150 μm (35 g m−2) were dip-coated in the ink and dried very slowly to obtain a composite that uniformly coated the substrate at ∼1.2 mg cm−2, shown in Fig. 2(a). The composite structure allows for a greater utilization of the anthraquinone repeating units in the polymers, and thus larger currents under applied potentials. The CNT mesh, shown in Fig. 2(f), provides a backbone to improve the conductivity of the conjugated PAQ via π–π interactions with the anthraquinone units (Fig. S3, ESI†); it also provides a porous matrix decorated by the polymer chains for better electrolyte penetration. This results in a larger surface area of the polymer being exposed to electrolyte, and an increased conductivity in the composite.34 The π–π interaction of the polymer chains and CNTs, and the subsequent decoration of the nanotubes with the polymer chains, shown in Fig. 2(e), also improved the suspension of the CNTs in the polymer solution, which resulted in very well dispersed inks. The ratio of PAQ to CNT was optimized, with the highest current per mass of active material (polymer) obtained at a 1:3, PAQ:CNT ratio by weight (Fig. S4, ESI†). The cyclic voltammograms in Fig. 3 shown in green (under N2) and red (under CO2) indicate the strong redox activity of these electrode surfaces; the differences in the current response following potential scans are discussed later.\n",

      "A sealed chamber was constructed in which CO2 capture and release on electrochemical activation and deactivation of the quinones, respectively, was indicated by the concomitant pressure changes in the chamber. A flow cell was also fabricated to house stacks of the electrochemical cells to allow for capture of CO2 from flowing gas streams of compositions similar to those of flue gases, air in aircraft cabins and buildings, and in the ambient environment. The adsorption effectiveness was assessed through analysis of the breakthrough profiles.\n",
      "The chemical specificity of quinones can provide near 100% purity of released CO2, which, when combined with a well-designed process in which 100% CO2 recovery is achieved, puts the technology much closer to the upper-right corner on the recovery-purity Pareto plot than those based on current CO2 sorbents.32,33\n",

      "Poly(1,4-anthraquinone) (P14AQ), shown in Fig. 1, was synthesized and incorporated into an ink with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Non-woven carbon fiber mat electrode substrates of thickness 150 μm (35 g m−2) were dip-coated in the ink and dried very slowly to obtain a composite that uniformly coated the substrate at ∼1.2 mg cm−2, shown in Fig. 2(a). The composite structure allows for a greater utilization of the anthraquinone repeating units in the polymers, and thus larger currents under applied potentials. The CNT mesh, shown in Fig. 2(f), provides a backbone to improve the conductivity of the conjugated PAQ via π–π interactions with the anthraquinone units (Fig. S3, ESI†); it also provides a porous matrix decorated by the polymer chains for better electrolyte penetration. This results in a larger surface area of the polymer being exposed to electrolyte, and an increased conductivity in the composite.34 The π–π interaction of the polymer chains and CNTs, and the subsequent decoration of the nanotubes with the polymer chains, shown in Fig. 2(e), also improved the suspension of the CNTs in the polymer solution, which resulted in very well dispersed inks. The ratio of PAQ to CNT was optimized, with the highest current per mass of active material (polymer) obtained at a 1:3, PAQ:CNT ratio by weight (Fig. S4, ESI†). The cyclic voltammograms in Fig. 3 shown in green (under N2) and red (under CO2) indicate the strong redox activity of these electrode surfaces; the differences in the current response following potential scans are discussed later.\n",

      "1. Limited adsorption capacity: The bed configuration described in the approach has a limited adsorption capacity of approximately 9-14 cm3 of CO2 per cell. This may restrict the overall amount of CO2 that can be captured and may require frequent regeneration or replacement of the bed.\n",

      "2. Channeling and dispersion effects: Imperfect packing of the cells in the flow device can lead to channeling and large-scale device axial dispersion. These effects can result in broad breakthrough curves and reduce the efficiency of the carbon capture system. However, it is anticipated that under optimal manufacturing conditions, these effects can be significantly reduced.\n",

      "Mizen and Wrighton first demonstrated the reductive addition of CO2 to 9,10-phenanthrenequinone in aprotic electrolytes. Quinones undergo two reversible one-electron reductions in aprotic electrolytes, at two reduction potentials, as shown in Scheme 1(a) for anthraquinone. But in the presence of CO2, a single two-electron quasi-reversible reduction takes place at the first reduction potential, as shown in Scheme 1(b), where the CO2 molecule carboxylates the quinone resulting in a carbonate salt.37 Upon the first reduction of a quinone molecule, a semiquinone radical anion is produced. Some semiquinones, with sufficient electron density, i.e. sufficient Lewis base strength, can react with CO2 in a nucleophilic addition to form a carbonate salt. Semiquinones with lower electron density – due to attached electron withdrawing groups – do not have the nucleophilic strength to react with CO2.38 A semiquinone carboxylated by the reductive addition of CO2 has its negative charge isolated from the rest of the molecule by a σ-bond, rendering the carboxylated quinone aromatic ring(s) relatively neutral. Hence, the two-electron reduction of the parent quinone under CO2 occurs at the first reduction potential. The second reduction generates another nucleophilic center, i.e. the second oxygen of the quinone, which reacts with a second CO2 molecule to form a bis(carbonate) dianion salt – the quinol dianion diadduct.

      "CO2 deprivation was not a problem in the highly saturated electrolyte in the CV electrochemical characterizations, where the concentration of CO2 in the electrolyte was about 20 times higher than that of the quinones on the electrode. However, in an adsorption system, where the electrolyte is not saturated with CO2 there needs to be a careful balance between the advective and diffusive fluxes of CO2 towards the anthraquinone cathodes for reductive addition, and the rate of the reduction of anthraquinone. This can be better controlled by charging the cell, i.e. reducing the anthraquinone, at a constant potential that is sufficient to drive the first reduction of anthraquinone but not the second, i.e. charging the cell at a potential difference that is between ΔV1 and ΔV2. With operation at this constant potential, the flux of CO2 does not affect the energy of binding, since the second electron is acquired by a semiquinone at the first reduction potential, but only after the first CO2 addition occurs; following this second reduction, a second CO2 molecule can bind to the dianion monoadduct. When the first reduction is allowed in a CO2-lean environment at a constant potential, the current observed after the initial surge, which results from the first reduction, is proportional to the flux of CO2 towards the anthraquinone electrode. Nevertheless, this current ultimately diminishes due to the decrease in the number of semiquinones available to react with CO2. In a CO2-rich environment, at constant potential charging, the observed current after the initial surge is proportional to the transport of CO2 into the electrode and the rate of the addition reaction which follows the nucleophilic addition mechanism between semiquinones and dissolved CO2, R = kCQ˙−CCO2,IL(4)where R is the rate of the reaction and k is the rate constant. The electrochemical steps proceed at a faster rate than the chemical reactions, but both types of reactions have rates that are faster than the rate of diffusion of CO2 in the IL, leading to a large Damköhler number, (5)where CQ is the initial concentration of anthraquinone repeat units on the electrode, CCO2 is the concentration of CO2 in the IL, L is the thickness of the IL-wetted porous electrode, which is about 150 μm, and DCO2,IL is the diffusion coefficient of CO2 in the IL and is about 4 × 10−10 m2 s−1. While it is the semiquinone that participates in the reaction here, the initial concentration CQ is a good approximation for estimating the order of magnitude of Da. The rate constant can be estimated to be 102 M−1 s−1,37 resulting in Da ∼104. Large values of Da indicate that mass transfer will control the process and thus the charging and subsequent carboxylation of the quinones can be assumed to be in equilibrium with the prevailing CO2 concentration at any position and at any time.

      "The simulation of constant-current charging at 0–5% CO2 concentrations in the sealed system in which the gas channel shown in Fig. 9 served as a gas headspace, shows results that are consistent with the aforementioned mechanism of CO2 capture. In addition to the cell voltage, the concentrations of all the cathode quinonic species were studied during the charging process. Fig. 10 shows the cell voltages at 0–5% CO2 and the concentration profiles of cathode species at 0, 2, and 5% CO2. The cell voltage profiles in Fig. 10(a) show that as the concentration of CO2 increases, less of the cell charging occurs at the higher potential. At 0% CO2 the cell simply traverses both reduction potentials of the quinone, and the species profiles in Fig. 10(b) show two consecutive conversions; the first is the reduction of quinone to semiquinone, and the second is the reduction of semiquinone to quinol dianion. The second reaction starts only after all the quinone is converted to semiquinone, and to further accommodate the incoming electrons at the constant current, the second, more energetic reduction takes place until all faradaic reactions are exhausted. Here, the simulation was stopped just short of full conversion to avoid numerical complications that arise from the exhaustion of faradaic material, i.e. complete charging. At 2% CO2, upon generation of the semiquinone, shown in Fig. 10(c), the modest diffusive flux of CO2 allows for the formation of the semiquinone monoadduct which soon accepts a second electron at the first reduction potential of quinone, hence extending the cell charging period spent at the lower potential. This dianion monoadduct can then react with a second CO2 molecule, to form the dianion diadduct. But, upon the depletion of CO2 in the vicinity of the cathode, due to a charging rate that is faster than the diffusive flux of CO2 into the electrolyte at 2% headspace concentration, the semiquinone is converted to the dianion at the higher second potential, while the concentrations of the dianion monoadduct and the dianion diadduct remain constant. This is reflected in the potential profile at 2% CO2 in Fig. 10(a). However, at 5% CO2, the diffusive flux of CO2 is adequate, and barely any semiquinone can be detected since it is converted to semiquinone monoadduct, and other subsequent species, soon after generation, shown in Fig. 10(d).

Nevertheless, the overall capacity, indicated by the trapezoidal area under Cout/Cin = 1 and the breakthrough curves, remained constant. However, the effect of a stronger driving force on improved mass transfer is evident in Fig. 11(b), where at charging potentials that are closer to ΔV2, more of the dianion is generated in a Nernstian distribution, which provides two reaction sites for CO2. This results in a stronger driving force in the adsorption of CO2 and hence improved mass transfer, which yields a sharper breakthrough profile.\n",

In this case, the flux of the released CO2 is proportional to the current density, as given by eqn (3). The discharge current and time, control the charge transferred, which is the extensive variable in the work of the process. This method of release is seldom utilized in swing adsorption processes, because it is the intensive, rather than the extensive variable, that is modulated, e.g., temperature in thermal swing, pressure in pressure swing, and, here, potential. Nevertheless, this can be useful for fast regeneration of the bed at high currents, where long periods of capture and short periods of release are desired. But due to the incomplete discharge of the electrochemical cells, in analogy with high current discharge of batteries,30 the bed will only be partially regenerated.\n",
      "Swing operations\n",
      "The electro-swing adsorption (ESA) technology developed in this work has a number of perceived advantages over other swing technologies such as temperature- (TSA) and pressure-swing (PSA) adsorption in terms of both its mode of operation and its thermodynamic adsorption characteristics, as illustrated in Fig. 13. Temperature-swing operations require heating and cooling of the entire adsorption matrix to release the adsorbed compounds, rather than just targeting the adsorption sites themselves, which introduces many thermal inefficiencies to the operation. The heating is typically accomplished with high-temperature steam as the sweep gas, with subsequent condensation of the steam to recover the pure CO2 product stream, whereas cooling is achieved during the blowdown phase in preparation for the next sorption cycle. With pressure-swing operations, the release of the captured material occurs on reduction of the adsorbate partial pressure in the sweep to reverse the mass transfer driving force, which can be achieved either by drawing a vacuum on the bed, or by using low pressure steam as the sweep gas. The product leaving the bed is dilute, and requires a second separation step, such as the condensation of steam, and external compression of the resulting CO2 to bring it to the desired pressures for subsequent utilization or for transportation and subsurface sequestration in geologic formations. Moreover, in both TSA and PSA operations, the working capacity is strongly dependent on the shape of the Langmuir- (or Freundlich-) type isotherm, with significantly lower capacities at lower concentrations, which limits the degree of regeneration of the adsorbent, or the partial pressure of the recovered adsorbate in the sweep stream. The electro-swing adsorbents, on the other hand, are characterized by a rectangular adsorption isothe\n",

      "The electro-swing operations outlined in this paper offer a new approach to the exploitation of electrochemically mediated complexation of CO2 with redox-active species for the mitigation of CO2 emissions, and for control of CO2 levels in confined environments. Electro-swing adsorption has been shown to be equally effective, at a constant capacity, for the capture of CO2 at concentrations typical of fossil fuel combustion flue gases (∼10%) and in confined ambient environments (0.6–0.8%). These advances have been made possible by the development of new electrode materials in which redox-active moieties, such as quinones, that can bind CO2 in one oxidation state but not in another are immobilized onto the electrode substrates. These functionalized electrodes were incorporated into an electrochemical cell assembly to facilitate their cyclical electrochemical reduction and oxidation. The cells demonstrated exceptional capture and release of CO2 over more than 7000 cycles at 60–70% quinone utilization, 90% faradaic efficiency, and 90 kJ mol−1 at 100% bed utilization and 43 kJ mol−1 at 60%.

      "1. Lack of detailed information: The related information provided does not give a clear description of the carbon capture system itself, its design, or the specific mechanisms used for capturing CO2. This makes it difficult to assess the potential limitations and problems with the approach.\n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "Recent estimates report that CO 2emissions in the world were more than 33 Gton in\n",
      "2018 [ 1]. In order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, several international agreements\n",
      "were signed: the Conference of the Parties (COP21) held at Paris on the 12 December 2015\n",
      "was a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\n",
      "2/1.5\u000eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was conﬁrmed\n",
      "by the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\n",
      "national determined contribution (NDC) was deﬁned [ 3]. However, in order to achieve this\n",
      "objective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\n",
      "not enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\n",
      "For this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\n",
      "removal (CDR) technologies, will have a crucial role in the coming years to achieve the\n",
      "CO 2level deﬁned by the environmental agreements and stabilize the CO 2concentration\n",
      "between 350 and 440 ppm [6,7].\n",
      "Negative emissions technologies are deﬁned as the intentional human effort to remove\n",
      "CO 2emissions from the atmosphere and include the following: afforestation and reforesta-\n",
      "tion (AR), soil carbon sequestration (SCS), biochar (BC), bioenergy with carbon capture and\n",
      "storage (BECCS), direct air capture (DAC), enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization\n",
      "(EW) and ocean fertilization (OF) [ 8]. Among these solutions, the research community has\n",
      "been focused for the most part on DAC, due to its advantages [9].\n",
      "DAC was used for decades to produce CO 2-free air to support life in submarines and\n",
      "spacecraft systems [ 10,11]; it was presented by Lackner as a GHG mitigation technology\n",
      "only in 1999 [ 12]. DAC captures CO 2from the atmosphere to store it as part of a CDR\n",
      "process in the long term (direct air carbon capture and storage—DACCS). Integrated\n",
      "DAC systems have also been studied to supply climate-neutral CO 2for chemical processes\n",

      "FIVE WHYS TO UNDERSTAND AN APPROACH'S MAIN FINDINGS: \n",
      " 1. Why was the research conducted?\n",
      "The research was conducted to find solutions for the environmental problem of increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, which causes climate change and global warming. The goal was to explore negative emissions technologies, specifically direct air capture (DAC), as a means to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and potentially achieve net negative global emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Why is DAC considered an important technology?\n",
      "DAC is considered important because it offers several advantages. It is independent of CO2 source location, as CO2 is distributed homogeneously throughout the atmosphere. It can tackle emissions from the transport sector and other small sources. DAC is also versatile and can be used for long-term storage and sequestration of CO2 (DACCS) or for short-term utilization in chemical processes (DACCU). Additionally, DAC contributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals and does not require arable land.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Why are absorption and adsorption technologies the most studied in DAC?\n",
      "Absorption and adsorption technologies are the most studied in DAC because they are mature and well-established technologies. They have been extensively analyzed in the literature and offer promising potential for CO2 capture from the air. These technologies have been used in various applications and industries, making them a focus of research and development in the field of DAC.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Why are thermodynamic issues significant in DAC?\n",
      "Thermodynamic issues are significant in DAC because they determine the minimum amount of energy required for CO2 separation from the air. The dilute nature of CO2 in the atmosphere, with a partial pressure about 350 times lower than coal flue gas, necessitates the processing of large volumes of air to capture a significant amount of CO2. This results in high energy and cost requirements for DAC systems. Understanding and addressing these thermodynamic challenges is crucial for improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of DAC technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Why is reducing costs and improving efficiency important for large-scale DAC deployment?\n",
      "Reducing costs and improving efficiency are important for large-scale DAC deployment because they are key factors in making the technology economically viable and scalable. Lowering the cost of DAC systems would make them more accessible and attractive for widespread implementation. Improving efficiency would reduce the energy requirements and associated costs, making DAC more sustainable and economically feasible. These efforts are necessary to accelerate the development and deployment of DAC at a large scale to achieve significant CO2 reduction and negative emissions.\n",

      "2018 [ 1]. In order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, several international agreements\n",
      "were signed: the Conference of the Parties (COP21) held at Paris on the 12 December 2015\n",
      "was a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\n",
      "2/1.5\u000eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was conﬁrmed\n",
      "by the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\n",

      "objective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\n",
      "not enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\n",
      "For this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\n",

      "Get e-AlertsAbstractCurrent methods for CO2 capture and concentration (CCC) are energy intensive due to their reliance on thermal cycles, which are intrinsically Carnot limited in efficiency. In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\n",

The system operates under large current densities, enabling fast CO2 capture while maintaining high Faradaic efficiencies. The triple-phase boundary created at the cathode allows for rapid diffusion of CO2, further enhancing capture rates and efficiencies.\n",

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone–hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35 nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, comparable to 530 mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90 mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35 nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, comparable to 530 mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90 mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications.

Introduction\\nRecent estimates report that CO 2emissions in the world were more than 33 Gton in\\n2018 [ 1]. In order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, several international agreements\\nwere signed: the Conference of the Parties (COP21) held at Paris on the 12 December 2015\\nwas a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\\n2/1.5\\x0eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was conﬁrmed\\nby the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\\nnational determined contribution (NDC) was deﬁned [ 3]. However, in order to achieve this\\nobjective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\\nnot enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\\nFor this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\\nremoval (CDR) technologies, will have a crucial role in the coming years to achieve the\\nCO 2level deﬁned by the environmental agreements and stabilize the CO 2concentration\\nbetween 350 and 440 ppm [6,7].\\nNegative emissions technologies are deﬁned as the intentional human effort to remove\\nCO 2emissions from the atmosphere and include the following: afforestation and reforesta-\\ntion (AR), soil carbon sequestration (SCS), biochar (BC), bioenergy with carbon capture and\\nstorage (BECCS), direct air capture (DAC), enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization\\n(EW) and ocean fertilization (OF) [ 8]. Among these solutions, the research community has\\nbeen focused for the most part on DAC, due to its advantages [9].\\nDAC was used for decades to produce CO 2-free air to support life in submarines and\\nspacecraft systems [ 10,11]; it was presented by Lackner as a GHG mitigation technology\\nonly in 1999 [ 12].

In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\\nTerms & Conditions\\nMost electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.

Third, the triple-phase boundary created at \\nthe cathode of our solid-electrolyte reactor allows for rapid diffu -\\nsion of CO2 in the gas phase towards the catalyst–membrane inter -\\nface26–28, enabling the reactor to operate under large current densities \\nfor fast CO2 capture while still maintaining high Faradaic efficiencies. \\nThis is different from the traditional pH-swing method, in which the \\nliquid-phase mass diffusion limits the rates of CO2 adsorption (through \\ngas–liquid contact). Fourth, the capture system can take advantage \\nof past advancements in fuel cells and water-splitting catalysts for \\nhigh energy efficiencies and easy scalability. Finally, our PSE device \\nenables a continuous, simultaneous and integrated carbon-capture \\nand release process, which differs from traditional absorption/desorp -\\ntion cycles and simplifies the carbon-capture system for many on-site \\napplications (Fig.\\xa0 1d).Concept verification\\nTo validate the proposed CO2-capture mechanism, we used commercial \\nPt/C and IrO2 as the electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, respectively29. \\nDifferent CO2:O2 ratios were used to establish a fundamental under -\\nstanding of the intrinsic CO2-separation performance of the system \\n(Methods and Supplementary Figs.\\xa02 and 3). As shown in Fig.\\xa02a, the \\nORR/OER I–V curves under different CO2 concentrations were similar, \\nsuggesting that the O2 concentration instead of the CO2 concentration \\ndetermines the cell activity.

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone–hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35\\xa0nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520\\xa0mV at a current density of 10\\xa0mA\\xa0cm−2, comparable to 530\\xa0mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90\\xa0mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications.

The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30 percent loss of capacity after 7000 cycles.\n",

      "was a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\n",
      "2/1.5\u000eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was conﬁrmed\n",
      "by the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\n",

      "objective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\n",
      "not enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\n",
      "For this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\n",

      "were signed: the Conference of the Parties (COP21) held at Paris on the 12 December 2015\n",
      "was a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\n",
      "2/1.5\u000eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was conﬁrmed\n",
      "by the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\n",
      "national determined contribution (NDC) was deﬁned [ 3]. However, in order to achieve this\n",
      "objective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\n",
      "not enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\n",
      "For this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\n",

      "Get e-AlertsAbstractCurrent methods for CO2 capture and concentration (CCC) are energy intensive due to their reliance on thermal cycles, which are intrinsically Carnot limited in efficiency. In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\n",

We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\n",

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone–hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35 nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, comparable to 530 mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90 mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications. To study the interface, thin films of a PPy/[Sn(dmit)3]2 were electrochemically grown with the aid of a microcell typically used in scanning tunneling microscopy assays. Raman and FTIR spectroscopies showed the effect of dimensionality on those materials, especially on the vibrational modes of dmit ring and on the 75 nm thick PPy/[Sn (dmit)3]2 film, which presents an optimized polymer chain conjunction length and a 20 % greater contribution to the polaron charge carriers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed the polaron/bipolaron ratio data, allowing us to determine other contributions to the surface charge density. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images show the hybrid thin film's different growth modes and the roughness evolution as a function of the electrochemical signal used in the synthesis.Acetylcholinesterase modified inkjet-printed graphene/gold nanoparticle/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) hybrid electrode for ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection2023, BioelectrochemistryShow abstractThis study successfully created a portable acetylcholinesterase sensor on a printed hybrid electrode capable of detecting chlorpyrifos in the field. While a screen-printed electrode was chosen herein to enable a single-use and portable platform for the in-field application, the hybrid material was incorporated to ensure ultrasensitive detection at lower electrode potentials. The hybrid ink of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated on graphene (GP) sheets in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was synthesized through a simple completely-green one-pot process. The subsequent characterization was carried out via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The synergy resulting from the greater surface area and enhanced transfer of electrons combined with high levels of electrocatalytic activity and superb conductivity offered by GP, AuNP, and PEDOT:PSS allows the sensor to exhibit ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection at the relatively low detection limit of 0.07 nM. The sensor demonstrated in this study also exhibits good reproducibility, desirable stability, and a successful application for the real sample with satisfactory recovery results of around 106 %, indicating its potential for use as a tool in the analysis of pesticides.Enzyme based bioelectrocatalysis over laccase immobilized poly-thiophene supported carbon fiber paper for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone2022, Molecular CatalysisShow abstractA modified electrode based on laccase immobilized poly-thiophene-3-carboxylic acid supported on carbon fiber paper was developed for the electrocatalytic oxidation of D-ribofuranose to otherwise difficult-to-access D-ribonolactone, a precursor for C-nucleoside based drug like Remdesivir. The electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuranose was achieved by the TEMPO-mediated electrochemical process. The experimental parameters were optimized and validated using Design of Experiment (DoE) statistical tool indicating the concentration of TEMPO and stirring as important parameters in bulk electrolysis. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuronose followed single electron anodic oxidation of TEMPO mediated by laccase to the corresponding oxoammonium nitrosonium species which was vital for the mediated electrochemical oxidation. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation was established using cyclic voltammetry and computational studies. The plausible interactions of laccase enzyme with TEMPO mediator were studied using molecular docking experiments. This facile method was successfully applied for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone.Electropolymerized melamine for simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine2020, Food ChemistryShow abstractPoly(melamine) (PMel) was synthesized via the electropolymerization of melamine monomer, which was then characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The possible polymerization mechanisms of melamine were also revealed by FT-IR spectroscopy and UV–Vis spectroscopy. Next, the PMel modified GCE (PMel/GCE) was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite (NO2−) and tartrazine, and the parameters were optimized. The kinetic study showed that the electrochemical oxidation of nitrite and tartrazine at the surface of PMel/GCE is a typical surface-controlled electrode process. Under the optimun conditions, the developed sensor outperformed those previously reported, and it also exhibited high selectivity and reproducibility. Finally, the PMel/GCE was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine in foodstuffs, and the results indicated that the proposed sensor could be a promising candidate for accurate determination of nitrite and tartrazine in real food samples.The role of electrolytically deposited palladium and platinum metal nanoparticles dispersed onto poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene) for enhanced glucose electrooxidation in biofuel cells2020, Electrochimica ActaShow abstractGlucose biofuel cells are one of the promising power supplies with a competent long-term stability and power density. In this respect, catalysts of palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) metal nanoparticles film coated electrode were fabricated for biofuel cell. The Pt and Pd particles were electrochemically deposited onto glassy carbon (GC) electrode modified with poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene), (p-1,8-DAN), via single or layer-by-layer electrodeposition. In results, Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC and Pd-Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC shell-core catalysts were fabricated and characterized by several analytical techniques such as AFM, EDX,SEM, TEM, and XPS, in addition to electrochemical methods. Their catalytic electrooxidation behaviors of glucose were investigated in alkaline medium. The as-prepared nano-catalysts showed improved electrocatalytic performances and better stability for glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) due to the presence of metal nanoparticles. The Pd as core and Pt as shell in Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC catalyst exhibited higher electrochemically accessible surface area (157.58 m2/g) and a favored electrooxidation efficiency. Moreover, the bimetallic Pt-Pd shell-core electrode showed higher resistance to poisoning (tolerance 1.24) and a decrease in the onset potential to -0.28 V. These multipurpose electro-catalysts are a potential candidate for developing a novel glucose biofuel cell.View all citing articles on ScopusResearch articleRecent advances in the synthesis of conducting polymers from the vapour phaseProgress in Materials Science, Volume 86, 2017, pp. 127-146Show abstractInherently conducting polymers (ICPs) combine the electrical properties of metals and semiconductors with a polymer’s ability to flex and/or stretch. In general, polymers are relatively simple to synthesise, however, ICPs themselves have had limited uptake in consumer devices. This lack of uptake is in part related to the insolubility of many ICPs in common industrial solvents, and hence methods to manufacture them in a usable form have been problematic. Vapour phase polymerisation (VPP) is one method that provides a convenient route to producing thin films of both soluble and insoluble ICPs, and nanocomposites thereof. In this critical review the VPP process will be discussed from the fundamental viewpoint of the proposed polymerisation mechanism and the parameters affecting polymer growth for a range of different monomers (thiophene, 3-hexylthiophene, pyrrole, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, etc.). Looking forward into the future, new areas of polymer design and fabrication using VPP will be discussed, such as the enhancement of ICPs through additives, and next generation device fabrication based upon VPP ICPs.Research articleConducting polymeric nanocomposites: A review in solar fuel applicationsFuel, Volume 325, 2022, Article 124899Show abstractOver the last few decades, research is being carried out in the field of photocatalysis to investigate for fuels production in sustainable manner. Due to an energy depletion and CO2 emission in the current situation urge us to produce alternative fuels. Water splitting and the reduction of carbon dioxide using various photocatalysts are being developed as promising sustainable methods to obtain eco-friendly energy sources. Conducting polymers (CP) stand out among the current pool of studied photocatalysts due to their high light absorption efficiency, good stability, tunable electronic characteristics, and cost effectiveness. Various CP, such as polyaniline, polythiophene, and polypyrrole have been integrated with different semiconducting nanomaterials to produce photocatalytic composites. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the synthesis of CP and their nanocomposites for application in CO2 photoreduction and water splitting into fuel production using different polymeric composites. Many composite photocatalysts show synergistic effects between the polymeric material and other counterparts in the composite. The improvement in the inactivity of the composite can be attributed to the band configurations of the composite. Improving the separation of excitons, widening the light absorption region, enhancing the substrate adsorption, and preventing photocorrosion conductive polymers can significantly increase the photocatalytic activity under visible light. The addition of conducting polymers with an inorganic materials dramatically change their band positions and may reduce the possiblilty of electron hole recombination. Here, we explain by what means conductive polymeric material can improve the efficiency of the composite in an organized manner, thereby providing a comprehensive reference to the field. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of polymeric catalysts have been discussed briefly.Research articlePolyaniline/polyvinyl alcohol blends: Effect of sulfonic acid dopants on microstructural, optical, thermal and electrical propertiesSynthetic Metals, Volume 191, 2014, pp. 126-134Show abstractThis correspondence reports the preparation and performance of different polyaniline–polyvinyl blends (PANI–PVA) doped with sulfonated acids. PANI is prepared by in situ dispersion polymerisation, and a subsequent extensive study determines the effect of protonation upon doping with four different types of acids. We obtain the blends by changing the four different dopants, viz. β-naphtalenesulfonic acid (NSA), camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) and p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA), while maintaining constant PANI and PVA concentrations. The polymer thin films are deposited on glass substrates by the dip-cast procedure. Lastly, the films of the obtained blends are characterised by surface, structural morphology (elemental analysis, AFM, SEM, FTIR and XRD), thermal properties (TGA and DSC) and UV–vis spectroscopy. The morphological analysis shows that the nanoparticles form different shapes, which depend on the type of dopant, whereas the FTIR spectra show the chemical interaction between the two polymers. The thermal study reveals three-step degradation of the polymer blends. To confirm the possible use of these blends in the electrical industry, the electrical properties are studied by in-plane I–V characteristics and four probe conductivity measurements.Research articleIntrinsically conducting polymers in electrochemical energy technology: Trends and progressElectrochimica Acta, Volume 122, 2014, pp. 93-107Show abstractThe use of intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) like polythiophene (PTh), polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) in devices and systems for electrochemical energy storage and conversion is briefly reviewed with a focus on an overview distinguishing between already established uses and potential applications. Basic principles in these three major fields are highlighted:•ICPs as active masses.•ICPs as conductance-enhancing additives.•ICPs as auxiliary materials beyond conductance.Research articleMultifunctional electrocatalysts derived from conducting polymer and metal organic framework complexesNano Energy, Volume 45, 2018, pp. 127-135Show abstractHigh cost, scarcity, and detrimental environmental effect of the noble-metal based catalysts have prompted the seek of less expensive, more benign, and earth abundant substitutes for energy conversion and storage. Here, we demonstrate a novel multifunctional electrocatalyst constructed by pyrolysis of the complex of polyaniline (PANI) and metal organic framework [Co-based MOF; zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67)]. The resultant PANI/ZIF-67 complex unveiled excellent electrocatalytic activities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. It was found that the catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 complex towards ORR, OER and HER could be tuned by simple changing the weight ratio of PANI to the MOF. Further, we tested the material as an air electrode for a primary zinc-air battery, demonstrating an open-circuit potential of 1.42 V and a peak power density of ~ 45 mW cm−2 - both are superior to those of its counterpart of the Pt/C air-electrode. The excellent multifunctional catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 are mainly attributed to the synergistic combination of cobalt nanoparticles, Co3O4, and nitrogen doped carbon from the PANI/ZIF-67 complex after pyrolysis.Research articleProtective polymeric films for industrial substrates: A critical review on past and recent applications with conducting polymers and polymer composites/nanocompositesProgress in Materials Science, Volume 104, 2019, pp. 380-450Show abstractCorrosion defined as the deterioration of a material when it interacts with its environment is a global problem. Among the different strategies employed to combat corrosion, the use of coatings and corrosion inhibitors are the most popular. Coatings or corrosion inhibitors form a layer over the metallic substrate and protect it against corrosion. Polymers, both naturally occurring and synthetic have been tested for metal corrosion protection as replacement for the toxic inorganic and organic corrosion inhibitors. Interest in them stems from their availability, cost effectiveness, and eco-friendliness (especially for natural polymers) in addition to the inherent stability and multiple adsorption centers. However, it is found that most polymeric materials studied are moderate corrosion inhibitors. Several attempts such as copolymerization, addition of substances that exert synergistic effect, cross linking, blending, and most recently incorporation of inorganic substances in nano size into the polymer matrix have been made to improve the inhibition ability of polymers. In this review, the application of conducting polymers, polymer composites and nanocomposites for corrosion protection of different industrial metal substrates are explored based on reported experimental data and their mechanism of inhibition explained. Some identified drawbacks and future direction in this area have also been highlighted.View full textCopyright © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.\n",

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35 nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, comparable to 530 mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90 mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications. To study the interface, thin films of a PPy/[Sn(dmit)3]2 were electrochemically grown with the aid of a microcell typically used in scanning tunneling microscopy assays. Raman and FTIR spectroscopies showed the effect of dimensionality on those materials, especially on the vibrational modes of dmit ring and on the 75 nm thick PPy/[Sn (dmit)3]2 film, which presents an optimized polymer chain conjunction length and a 20 % greater contribution to the polaron charge carriers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed the polaron/bipolaron ratio data, allowing us to determine other contributions to the surface charge density. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images show the hybrid thin film's different growth modes and the roughness evolution as a function of the electrochemical signal used in the synthesis.Acetylcholinesterase modified inkjet-printed graphene/gold nanoparticle/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) hybrid electrode for ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection2023, BioelectrochemistryShow abstractThis study successfully created a portable acetylcholinesterase sensor on a printed hybrid electrode capable of detecting chlorpyrifos in the field. While a screen-printed electrode was chosen herein to enable a single-use and portable platform for the in-field application, the hybrid material was incorporated to ensure ultrasensitive detection at lower electrode potentials. The hybrid ink of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated on graphene (GP) sheets in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was synthesized through a simple completely-green one-pot process. The subsequent characterization was carried out via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The synergy resulting from the greater surface area and enhanced transfer of electrons combined with high levels of electrocatalytic activity and superb conductivity offered by GP, AuNP, and PEDOT:PSS allows the sensor to exhibit ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection at the relatively low detection limit of 0.07 nM. The sensor demonstrated in this study also exhibits good reproducibility, desirable stability, and a successful application for the real sample with satisfactory recovery results of around 106 %, indicating its potential for use as a tool in the analysis of pesticides.Enzyme based bioelectrocatalysis over laccase immobilized poly-thiophene supported carbon fiber paper for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone2022, Molecular CatalysisShow abstractA modified electrode based on laccase immobilized poly-thiophene-3-carboxylic acid supported on carbon fiber paper was developed for the electrocatalytic oxidation of D-ribofuranose to otherwise difficult-to-access D-ribonolactone, a precursor for C-nucleoside based drug like Remdesivir. The electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuranose was achieved by the TEMPO-mediated electrochemical process. The experimental parameters were optimized and validated using Design of Experiment (DoE) statistical tool indicating the concentration of TEMPO and stirring as important parameters in bulk electrolysis. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuronose followed single electron anodic oxidation of TEMPO mediated by laccase to the corresponding oxoammonium nitrosonium species which was vital for the mediated electrochemical oxidation. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation was established using cyclic voltammetry and computational studies. The plausible interactions of laccase enzyme with TEMPO mediator were studied using molecular docking experiments. This facile method was successfully applied for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone.Electropolymerized melamine for simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine2020, Food ChemistryShow abstractPoly(melamine) (PMel) was synthesized via the electropolymerization of melamine monomer, which was then characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The possible polymerization mechanisms of melamine were also revealed by FT-IR spectroscopy and UV–Vis spectroscopy. Next, the PMel modified GCE (PMel/GCE) was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite (NO2−) and tartrazine, and the parameters were optimized. The kinetic study showed that the electrochemical oxidation of nitrite and tartrazine at the surface of PMel/GCE is a typical surface-controlled electrode process. Under the optimun conditions, the developed sensor outperformed those previously reported, and it also exhibited high selectivity and reproducibility. Finally, the PMel/GCE was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine in foodstuffs, and the results indicated that the proposed sensor could be a promising candidate for accurate determination of nitrite and tartrazine in real food samples.The role of electrolytically deposited palladium and platinum metal nanoparticles dispersed onto poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene) for enhanced glucose electrooxidation in biofuel cells2020, Electrochimica ActaShow abstractGlucose biofuel cells are one of the promising power supplies with a competent long-term stability and power density. In this respect, catalysts of palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) metal nanoparticles film coated electrode were fabricated for biofuel cell. The Pt and Pd particles were electrochemically deposited onto glassy carbon (GC) electrode modified with poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene), (p-1,8-DAN), via single or layer-by-layer electrodeposition. In results, Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC and Pd-Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC shell-core catalysts were fabricated and characterized by several analytical techniques such as AFM, EDX,SEM, TEM, and XPS, in addition to electrochemical methods. Their catalytic electrooxidation behaviors of glucose were investigated in alkaline medium. The as-prepared nano-catalysts showed improved electrocatalytic performances and better stability for glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) due to the presence of metal nanoparticles. The Pd as core and Pt as shell in Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC catalyst exhibited higher electrochemically accessible surface area (157.58 m2/g) and a favored electrooxidation efficiency. Moreover, the bimetallic Pt-Pd shell-core electrode showed higher resistance to poisoning (tolerance 1.24) and a decrease in the onset potential to -0.28 V. These multipurpose electro-catalysts are a potential candidate for developing a novel glucose biofuel cell.View all citing articles on ScopusResearch articleRecent advances in the synthesis of conducting polymers from the vapour phaseProgress in Materials Science, Volume 86, 2017, pp. 127-146Show abstractInherently conducting polymers (ICPs) combine the electrical properties of metals and semiconductors with a polymer’s ability to flex and/or stretch. In general, polymers are relatively simple to synthesise, however, ICPs themselves have had limited uptake in consumer devices. This lack of uptake is in part related to the insolubility of many ICPs in common industrial solvents, and hence methods to manufacture them in a usable form have been problematic. Vapour phase polymerisation (VPP) is one method that provides a convenient route to producing thin films of both soluble and insoluble ICPs, and nanocomposites thereof. In this critical review the VPP process will be discussed from the fundamental viewpoint of the proposed polymerisation mechanism and the parameters affecting polymer growth for a range of different monomers (thiophene, 3-hexylthiophene, pyrrole, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, etc.). Looking forward into the future, new areas of polymer design and fabrication using VPP will be discussed, such as the enhancement of ICPs through additives, and next generation device fabrication based upon VPP ICPs.Research articleConducting polymeric nanocomposites: A review in solar fuel applicationsFuel, Volume 325, 2022, Article 124899Show abstractOver the last few decades, research is being carried out in the field of photocatalysis to investigate for fuels production in sustainable manner. Due to an energy depletion and CO2 emission in the current situation urge us to produce alternative fuels. Water splitting and the reduction of carbon dioxide using various photocatalysts are being developed as promising sustainable methods to obtain eco-friendly energy sources. Conducting polymers (CP) stand out among the current pool of studied photocatalysts due to their high light absorption efficiency, good stability, tunable electronic characteristics, and cost effectiveness. Various CP, such as polyaniline, polythiophene, and polypyrrole have been integrated with different semiconducting nanomaterials to produce photocatalytic composites. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the synthesis of CP and their nanocomposites for application in CO2 photoreduction and water splitting into fuel production using different polymeric composites. Many composite photocatalysts show synergistic effects between the polymeric material and other counterparts in the composite. The improvement in the inactivity of the composite can be attributed to the band configurations of the composite. Improving the separation of excitons, widening the light absorption region, enhancing the substrate adsorption, and preventing photocorrosion conductive polymers can significantly increase the photocatalytic activity under visible light. The addition of conducting polymers with an inorganic materials dramatically change their band positions and may reduce the possiblilty of electron hole recombination. Here, we explain by what means conductive polymeric material can improve the efficiency of the composite in an organized manner, thereby providing a comprehensive reference to the field. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of polymeric catalysts have been discussed briefly.Research articlePolyaniline/polyvinyl alcohol blends: Effect of sulfonic acid dopants on microstructural, optical, thermal and electrical propertiesSynthetic Metals, Volume 191, 2014, pp. 126-134Show abstractThis correspondence reports the preparation and performance of different polyaniline–polyvinyl blends (PANI–PVA) doped with sulfonated acids. PANI is prepared by in situ dispersion polymerisation, and a subsequent extensive study determines the effect of protonation upon doping with four different types of acids. We obtain the blends by changing the four different dopants, viz. β-naphtalenesulfonic acid (NSA), camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) and p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA), while maintaining constant PANI and PVA concentrations. The polymer thin films are deposited on glass substrates by the dip-cast procedure. Lastly, the films of the obtained blends are characterised by surface, structural morphology (elemental analysis, AFM, SEM, FTIR and XRD), thermal properties (TGA and DSC) and UV–vis spectroscopy. The morphological analysis shows that the nanoparticles form different shapes, which depend on the type of dopant, whereas the FTIR spectra show the chemical interaction between the two polymers. The thermal study reveals three-step degradation of the polymer blends. To confirm the possible use of these blends in the electrical industry, the electrical properties are studied by in-plane I–V characteristics and four probe conductivity measurements.Research articleIntrinsically conducting polymers in electrochemical energy technology: Trends and progressElectrochimica Acta, Volume 122, 2014, pp. 93-107Show abstractThe use of intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) like polythiophene (PTh), polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) in devices and systems for electrochemical energy storage and conversion is briefly reviewed with a focus on an overview distinguishing between already established uses and potential applications. Basic principles in these three major fields are highlighted:•ICPs as active masses.•ICPs as conductance-enhancing additives.•ICPs as auxiliary materials beyond conductance.Research articleMultifunctional electrocatalysts derived from conducting polymer and metal organic framework complexesNano Energy, Volume 45, 2018, pp. 127-135Show abstractHigh cost, scarcity, and detrimental environmental effect of the noble-metal based catalysts have prompted the seek of less expensive, more benign, and earth abundant substitutes for energy conversion and storage. Here, we demonstrate a novel multifunctional electrocatalyst constructed by pyrolysis of the complex of polyaniline (PANI) and metal organic framework [Co-based MOF; zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67)]. The resultant PANI/ZIF-67 complex unveiled excellent electrocatalytic activities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. It was found that the catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 complex towards ORR, OER and HER could be tuned by simple changing the weight ratio of PANI to the MOF. Further, we tested the material as an air electrode for a primary zinc-air battery, demonstrating an open-circuit potential of 1.42 V and a peak power density of ~ 45 mW cm−2 - both are superior to those of its counterpart of the Pt/C air-electrode. The excellent multifunctional catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 are mainly attributed to the synergistic combination of cobalt nanoparticles, Co3O4, and nitrogen doped carbon from the PANI/ZIF-67 complex after pyrolysis.Research articleProtective polymeric films for industrial substrates: A critical review on past and recent applications with conducting polymers and polymer composites/nanocompositesProgress in Materials Science, Volume 104, 2019, pp. 380-450Show abstractCorrosion defined as the deterioration of a material when it interacts with its environment is a global problem. Among the different strategies employed to combat corrosion, the use of coatings and corrosion inhibitors are the most popular. Coatings or corrosion inhibitors form a layer over the metallic substrate and protect it against corrosion. Polymers, both naturally occurring and synthetic have been tested for metal corrosion protection as replacement for the toxic inorganic and organic corrosion inhibitors. Interest in them stems from their availability, cost effectiveness, and eco-friendliness (especially for natural polymers) in addition to the inherent stability and multiple adsorption centers. However, it is found that most polymeric materials studied are moderate corrosion inhibitors. Several attempts such as copolymerization, addition of substances that exert synergistic effect, cross linking, blending, and most recently incorporation of inorganic substances in nano size into the polymer matrix have been made to improve the inhibition ability of polymers. In this review, the application of conducting polymers, polymer composites and nanocomposites for corrosion protection of different industrial metal substrates are explored based on reported experimental data and their mechanism of inhibition explained. Some identified drawbacks and future direction in this area have also been highlighted.View full textCopyright © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved. \n",

Introduction\\nRecent estimates report that CO 2emissions in the world were more than 33 Gton in\\n2018 [ 1]. In order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, several international agreements\\nwere signed: the Conference of the Parties (COP21) held at Paris on the 12 December 2015\\nwas a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\\n2/1.5\\x0eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was conﬁrmed\\nby the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\\nnational determined contribution (NDC) was deﬁned [ 3]. However, in order to achieve this\\nobjective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\\nnot enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\\nFor this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\\nremoval (CDR) technologies, will have a crucial role in the coming years to achieve the\\nCO 2level deﬁned by the environmental agreements and stabilize the CO 2concentration\\nbetween 350 and 440 ppm [6,7].\\nNegative emissions technologies are deﬁned as the intentional human effort to remove\\nCO 2emissions from the atmosphere and include the following: afforestation and reforesta-\\ntion (AR), soil carbon sequestration (SCS), biochar (BC), bioenergy with carbon capture and\\nstorage (BECCS), direct air capture (DAC), enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization\\n(EW) and ocean fertilization (OF) [ 8]. Among these solutions, the research community has\\nbeen focused for the most part on DAC, due to its advantages [9].\\nDAC was used for decades to produce CO 2-free air to support life in submarines and\\nspacecraft systems [ 10,11]; it was presented by Lackner as a GHG mitigation technology\\nonly in 1999 [ 12]. DAC captures CO 2from the atmosphere to store it as part of a CDR\\nprocess in the long term (direct air carbon capture and storage—DACCS). Integrated\\nDAC systems have also been studied to supply climate-neutral CO 2for chemical processes\\nAppl.

DAC is independent of CO 2source location,\\nbecause CO 2is distributed homogeneously throughout the atmosphere, minimizing or\\neliminating CO 2transportation costs when the capture plant is situated near the utilization\\nor storage site [ 16]; the capture plant can be located in a particular place where the the re-\\nnewable energy can be exploited at the minimum cost [ 17]; DAC can tackle emissions from\\nthe transport sector and other small sources that constitute about 50% of total emissions; air\\nis ubiquitous, with few contaminants that could cause the degradation of solvents/sorbents\\n(e.g., NO x, SO xand particulates) [18]; arable land is not required, avoiding loss of agricul-\\ntural land [ 9]; the technology contributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development\\nGoals (SDGs) 13, 9, 6 (by-product water could be used as fresh water in general), 8 (creation\\nof new green jobs), 7 (exploitation of renewable energies), 11 and 12 (production of fuels\\nand materials from atmospheric CO 2) and 3 (positive effect on health) [ 17]. However, there\\nare also some disadvantages: the long term storage and sequestration of CO 2are critical\\n(costs, long-term monitoring, potentially induced seismicity and leakage) [ 19]; low CO 2\\npartial pressure in the air, about 400 ppm, 350 times lower than coal ﬂue gas so that large\\nvolumes of air should be processed to capture a signiﬁcant amount of CO 2[7,13,20]; high\\nenergy and cost requirements due to the dilute nature of CO 2in the air, requiring a large\\nvolume of air to be treated [21].\\nDAC technologies include absorption, adsorption, ion exchange resin, mineral car-\\nbonation, membrane, photocatalysis, cryogenic separation, electrochemical approach and\\nelectrodialysis approaches [ 6,18,22–26]. Absorption and adsorption technologies are the\\nmost analyzed and studied in the literature [18].\\nDAC technologies are characterized by thermodynamic issues related to the separation\\nof CO 2from the air, which are more signiﬁcant than in the separation of CO 2from the ﬂue\\ngas [ 27]. Thermodynamic calculation provides the minimum amount of energy for a deﬁned\\nseparation depending on the temperature, pressure and initial and ﬁnal concentrations\\nof the streams. Generally, the minimum required thermodynamic work can be evaluated\\nby the difference in stream exergies, but for isothermal and isobaric processes it can be\\nobtained by the Gibbs free energy, as shown in the following equation and Figure 1 [ 28–30]\\n(see Equation (1)):\\nWmin=RT\\x10\\nNCO2\\nBlnyCO2\\nB+NB\\x00CO2\\nBlnyB\\x00CO2\\nB\\x11\\n+RT\\x10\\nNCO2\\nClnyCO2\\nC+NC\\x00CO2\\nClnyC\\x00CO2\\nC\\x11\\n\\x00RT\\x10\\nNCO2\\nAlnyCO2\\nA+NA\\x00CO2\\nAlnyA\\x00CO2\\nA\\x11 (1)\\nwhere Wminis the minimum separation work in kJ/mol, Ris the universal gas constant\\n8.314 J/(molK), Tis the temperature in K, n iCO2are CO 2moles in stream i, n ii\\x00CO2are\\nthe other moles in current i without CO 2, yiCO2is the CO 2mole fraction in current i and\\nyii\\x00CO2is the mole fraction of the remaining gas without CO 2in stream i.\\nAppl.

DAC is independent of CO 2 source location, be-\\ncause CO 2 is distributed homogeneously throughout the atmosphere, minimizing or elim-\\ninating CO 2 transportation costs when the capture plant is situated near the utilization or \\nstorage site [16]; the capture plant can be located in a particular place where the  the re-\\nnewable energy can be exploited at the  minimum cost [17]; DAC can tackle emissions from \\nthe transport sector and other small sources that constitute about 50% of total emissions; \\nair is ubiquitous , with few contaminants that could cause the degradation of sol-\\nvents/sorbents (e.g.,  NO x, SO x and particulates) [18]; arable land is not required , avoiding \\nloss of agricultural land [9]; the technology contributes to the achievement of Sustaina ble \\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) 13, 9, 6 (by -product water could be used as fresh water in \\ngeneral), 8 (creation of new green jobs), 7 (exploit ation  of renewable energies), 11 and 12 \\n(production of fuels and materials from atmospheric CO 2) and 3 (positive effect on health) \\n[17]. However, there are also some disadvantages : the long term storage and sequestration \\nof CO 2 are critical (costs, long- term monitoring, potentially induced seismicity and leak-\\nage) [19]; low CO 2 partial pressure in the air, about 400 ppm, 350 times lower than coal \\nflue gas so that large volumes of air should be processed to capture a significant amount \\nof CO 2 [7,13,20] ; high energy and cost requirements due to the dilute nature of CO 2 in the \\nair, requiring a large  volume of air to be treat ed [21].  \\nDAC technologies include absorption, adsorption, ion exchange resin, mineral car-\\nbonation, membrane, photoca talysis, cryogenic separation, electrochemical approach and \\nelectrodialysis approaches  [6,18,22 –26]. Absorption and adsorption technologies are the \\nmost analyzed and studied in the literature [18].  \\nDAC technologies are characterized by thermodynamic issues related to the separa-\\ntion of CO 2 from the air, which are more significant than in the separation of CO 2 from the \\nflue gas [27].  Thermodynamic calculation provides the minimum amount of energy for a \\ndefined separation depending on the temperature, pressure and initial and final concen-\\ntrations of the streams. Generally, the minimum required thermodynami c work can be \\nevaluated by the difference in stream exergies, but for isothermal and isobaric processes \\nit can be obtained by the Gibbs free energy , as shown in the following equation and Figure \\n1 [28–30] (see Eq uation  (1)):  \\n𝑊𝑊𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 = 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝑁𝑁𝐵𝐵𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑦𝑦𝐵𝐵𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2+𝑁𝑁𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵−𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑦𝑦𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵−𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2)+𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝑁𝑁𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑦𝑦𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2+𝑁𝑁𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶−𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑦𝑦𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶−𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2)\\n−𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝑁𝑁𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑦𝑦𝐴𝐴𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2+𝑁𝑁𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴−𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑦𝑦𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴−𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶2)  (1) \\nwhere Wmin is the minimum separation work in kJ/mol, R  is the universal gas constant \\n8.314 J/(molK), T  is the temperature in K, n iCO2 are CO 2 moles in stream i, n ii−CO2 are the \\nother moles in current i without CO 2, yiCO2 is the CO 2 mole fraction in current i and y ii−CO2 \\nis the mole fraction of the remaining gas without CO 2 in stream i.  \\n \\nFigure 1.

DAC Technologies\\nIn this section, an overview of DAC technologies is set forth. Absorption, adsorption,\\nion exchange resin, mineral carbonation, membrane, photocatalysis, cryogenic separation,\\nelectrochemical and electrodialysis approaches are investigated.Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 8321 4 of 41\\n2.1. Absorption\\nIn absorption technology for DAC, water solutions of strong bases containing hydrox-\\nide sorbents with a strong CO 2afﬁnity, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium\\nhydroxide (KOH) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2), are used [ 3]. The absorption with\\nCa(OH) 2was proposed by Lackner et al. [ 12] and it follows the reactions described be-\\nlow [18] (see Equations (2)–(4)):\\nCa(OH)2+CO 2!CaCO 3+H2ODH25\\x0eC=\\x00109 kJ/mol (2)\\nCaCO 3!CaO +CO 2DH900\\x0eC= + 179.2 kJ/mol (3)\\nCaO +H2O!Ca(OH)2DH\\x0e\\n100\\x0eC=\\x0064.5 kJ/mol (4)\\nThe reaction starts with calcium hydroxide and CO 2to form calcium carbonate\\n(CaCO 3). The obtained calcium carbonate is precipitated, accumulated, separated from\\nwater, dried and calcined above 900\\x0eC. In this step, calcium oxide (CaO) and CO 2(con-\\ncentrated stream) are obtained. Afterwards, calcium oxide is hydrated to produce calcium\\nhydroxide. This reaction scheme allows a closed cycle. However, there are some disadvan-\\ntages to this process, such as the great amount of lost water, high temperatures and high\\nrequired energies for the calcination step (179.2 kJ/mol), and the low solubility of calcium\\nhydroxide in water, which limits the hydroxide concentration for CO 2capture [3,18].\\nThe use of NaOH water solution was proposed by Baciocchi et al. [ 37] and has a\\nsimilarity to the Kraft process used in the paper industry to extract cellulose from wood.\\nCompared to Ca(OH) 2, NaOH solution allows a strong binding of CO 2but with a higher\\nsolubility of carbonate in water. In this process, there are two cycles working simultaneously.\\nIn the ﬁrst, CO 2is captured by NaOH to produce sodium carbonate (Na 2CO 3) in the\\nabsorber through an exothermic reaction evolving at ambient temperature and pressure (see\\nEquation (5)). In the second cycle, known as the regeneration cycle, NaOH is regenerated\\nin the causticizer/precipitator: Na 2CO 3reacts with Ca(OH) 2to produce NaOH and CaCO 3\\n(see Equation (6)). From calcium carbonate, CO 2(concentrated stream) is recovered in the\\ncalciner/kiln (see Equation (7)) and receives oxygen (O 2) from an air separation unit. As\\nmentioned above, this step requires a lot of energy, with temperatures above 900\\x0eC to\\nallow the removal of water and decomposition of CaCO 3. Afterwards, CaO is hydrated to\\nCa(OH) 2in the slaker (see Equation (8)) so that it can be sent to the precipitator to be used\\nagain [18]. Figure 3 shows the scheme of this process.\\nAbsorber 2Na(OH)+CO 2!Na2CO 3+H2ODH25\\x0eC=\\x00109.4 kJ/mol (5)\\nCausticizer Na 2CO 3+Ca(OH)2!2Na(OH)+CaCO 3DH100\\x0eC=\\x005.3 kJ/mol (6)\\nCalciner CaCO 3!CaO +CO 2DH900\\x0eC= + 179.2 kJ/mol (7)\\nSlaker CaO +H2O!Ca(OH)2DH100\\x0eC=\\x0064.5 kJ/mol (8)Appl.

Adsorption\\nWhile the absorption process mainly uses an aqueous solution of NaOH, KOH or\\nCa(OH) 2, the adsorption process is based on the chemical or physical adsorption of CO 2\\nwith particular sorbents, such as amine-functionalized sorbents, metal organic frameworks\\n(MOFs), zeolites, etc. [6]. Among chemisorbents, amine-functionalized sorbents and solid\\nalkali carbonates sorbents (bulk and supported) have been proposed, while, among ph-\\nysisorbents, MOFs, zeolites and new materials, such as boron nitride nanosheets and\\nnanotubes, have been investigated [ 18]. Amine-functionalized sorbents have received sig-\\nniﬁcant attention for DAC systems due to their stability under humidity, low regeneration\\ntemperatures (50–120\\x0eC) and ﬂexibility in the choice of low-cost support [39].\\nGenerally, in the adsorption system, a single equipment unit is used, where adsorption\\nand desorption happen alternately after variations in temperature or pressure or a combi-\\nnation of the two. Generally, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is not practicable in a real\\nprocess because a pressure lower than 0.4 mbar is required. At lab scale, the temperature\\nswing adsorption (TSA) is generally used, but the use of an inert gas purge results in\\na dilute output stream. On the other hand, temperature and vacuum swing adsorption\\n(TVSA) could be used to produce a high-CO 2purity stream.\\nMost studies reported in the literature on the adsorption process are on the investigation\\nof sorbents, evaluating adsorption capacities and performances, as discussed below.\\n2.2.1. Physisorbents\\nPhysisorption occurs between the sorbent surface and CO 2, allowing only a physical\\ninteraction. Generally, materials with porosity or nanometric dimensions, such as zeolites,\\nactivated carbon, MOFs and new materials, have been considered [ 54]. Activated carbons\\nare characterized by low cost and high thermal stability, showing an adsorption capacity\\nand selectivity lower than that of zeolites at a low CO 2partial pressure but higher at a high\\nCO 2partial pressure [ 55,56]. For this reason, activated carbons are not a good choice for\\ndirect air capture [6].\\nFactors inﬂuencing the CO 2capture of zeolites are size, charge density and distribution\\nof cations in the porous structure [ 57]. Humidity has a negative effect on CO 2capture, and\\nfor this reason zeolites are not suggested for direct air capture [6].\\nMOFs are characterized by ﬂexibility in shape, pore structure, pore size and surface\\nproperties [ 58]. Similar to activated carbons, adsorption capacity and selectivity are lower\\nat low CO 2partial pressures and in the presence of humidity; MOFs are suitable for CO 2\\nstorage and not for CO 2separation. However, in recent years, attention has been directed\\nto MOFs (particularly MIL-101(Cr)) functionalized with amine (adsorption of amines onto\\nmetal sites or physical impregnation with liquid amines) which provide better performances\\nfor CO 2capture from the air due to their durability under moist conditions [ 39]. Currently,\\nthe high cost of MOFs makes their use in DAC prohibitive [6].Appl.

In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\\nTerms & Conditions\\nMost electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.

The \\nredox-active carriers, such as quinones, have high energy efficiency \\nowing to their facile reaction kinetics involved in binding and releasing \\nCO2 molecules under reduced and oxidized states19,20. However, their \\npractical applications are still limited by low capture rates (typically \\n<10\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2) and sensitivity to O2 gas present in most CO2 sources. On \\nthe other hand, pH-swing methods using salt or water electrolysis to separate alkaline and acidic solutions, for CO2 absorption followed by \\nacidification to release CO2, have been reported to be insensitive to O2 \\nand can deliver larger currents (about 100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2)2,18 ,21,22. However, \\nthe decoupling of the electrolysis process from the CO2 absorption \\nprocess requires energy-intensive downstream gas–liquid contacting \\nprocesses, especially under low CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, \\nby-products such as H2 (from water splitting)23 or Cl2 (from NaCl elec-\\ntrolysis)24,25 generated in different pH-swing designs add complexity \\nand challenges to decentralized carbon capture.\\nHere we report a different carbon-capture design by coupling O2/\\nH2O electrolysis with our porous solid-electrolyte (PSE) reactor7 for a \\ncontinuous and modular CO2 capture from a wide range of CO2 sources \\nat industrially relevant capture rate, high energy efficiency, no O2 sen -\\nsitivity and easy scalability and adaptability.

By performing this OER/\\nORR redox electrolysis, the system does not consume or produce any \\nchemicals, as the generated O2 from the anode can be recycled back \\nto the cathode for a stoichiometric balance. To avoid flooding, an \\nanion-exchange membrane (AEM) and a cation-exchange membrane \\n(CEM) are inserted between the electrodes and the PSE layer.

These carbonate ions, driven by the electric field, then \\nmigrate across the AEM into the PSE layer. Meanwhile, water on the \\nanode side is oxidized to generate the same amount of O2 that gets \\nconsumed and releases protons (H+) that travel across the CEM into \\nthe middle layer to compensate the charge.

First, \\nunlike some redox-active carriers that can be poisoned by the coexist -\\ning O2 gas6, our proposed system fully uses O2 through ORR to create \\na strong interfacial alkaline environment for effective CO2 capture26. \\nSecond, there are no specific chemical inputs (other than water) or \\nconsumption during the capture process, as the device performs ORR/\\nOER redox electrolysis. Third, the triple-phase boundary created at \\nthe cathode of our solid-electrolyte reactor allows for rapid diffu -\\nsion of CO2 in the gas phase towards the catalyst–membrane inter -\\nface26–28, enabling the reactor to operate under large current densities \\nfor fast CO2 capture while still maintaining high Faradaic efficiencies. \\nThis is different from the traditional pH-swing method, in which the \\nliquid-phase mass diffusion limits the rates of CO2 adsorption (through \\ngas–liquid contact). Fourth, the capture system can take advantage \\nof past advancements in fuel cells and water-splitting catalysts for \\nhigh energy efficiencies and easy scalability. Finally, our PSE device \\nenables a continuous, simultaneous and integrated carbon-capture \\nand release process, which differs from traditional absorption/desorp -\\ntion cycles and simplifies the carbon-capture system for many on-site \\napplications (Fig.\\xa0 1d).Concept verification\\nTo validate the proposed CO2-capture mechanism, we used commercial \\nPt/C and IrO2 as the electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, respectively29. \\nDifferent CO2:O2 ratios were used to establish a fundamental under -\\nstanding of the intrinsic CO2-separation performance of the system \\n(Methods and Supplementary Figs.\\xa02 and 3). As shown in Fig.\\xa02a, the \\nORR/OER I–V curves under different CO2 concentrations were similar, \\nsuggesting that the O2 concentration instead of the CO2 concentration \\ndetermines the cell activity. The onset potential (under 0.5\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2) \\nis around 0.8\\u2009V, including OER and ORR overpotentials (around 200–\\n300\\u2009mV each), ohmic drops and pH overpotentials during electrolysis3. \\nUnder high current density, at which O2 mass diffusion starts to affect \\nORR activity, the I –V curve (without iR compensations; Supplementary \\nFig.\\xa04) of 4.6%\\u2009CO2 showed slightly better cell voltage than that of 8.6% \\nor 13.9% owing to its higher O2 partial pressure.\\nUnder a constant ORR/OER electrolysis current, we can obtain the \\nCO2-capture rate, which is equivalent to the CO2 crossover rate, by meas -\\nuring the CO2 flow rate out of the PSE layer using water-displacement \\nand titration methods for both the gas-phase and dissolved CO2 \\n(Methods and Supplementary Figs.\\xa05–7). This CO2 dissolution can be \\navoided in practical operations by continuously recycling the deion -\\nized water stream. The CO2 bubble formation within the PSE layer \\nwas found to have little impact on the middle-layer pressure or the \\ndevice operational stability (Supplementary Fig.\\xa08). Furthermore, the \\nrecovered gas product was confirmed to be high-purity CO2 through \\ngas chromatography analysis (up to 99.7% without considering water \\nvapour; Supplementary Fig.\\xa09), allowing for direct integration with \\ndownstream utilization or storage processes without the typical \\nenergy-intensive secondary purification processes.

As shown in Fig.\\xa02b , with 13.9%\\u2009CO2 \\nconcentration, the CO2-capture rate increased almost linearly with the \\nORR current density ranging from 10 to 500\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2. By estimating the \\nslope of the CO2-capture (or crossover) rate as a function of the ORR \\ncurrent, we found that, for every two-electron transfer during which \\ntwo OH− ions were generated, there was one CO2 molecule captured, \\nsuggesting that the CO2 crossover is mainly through the carbonate ion \\ninstead of bicarbonate because of the high local interfacial pH. This \\nconclusion is supported by the well-matched CO2-capture rates with \\nthe theoretical guideline, which assumes 100% carbonate crossover \\nand is consistent with observations reported in previous studies5,16,18,30. \\nTherefore, here we defined the carbonate Faradaic efficiency (FEcarbon -\\nate) to better evaluate the carbon-capture efficiencies under different \\nreaction conditions (Methods). The FEcarbonate  was maintained over 90% \\nacross a wide range of cell currents under 13.9%\\u2009CO2, suggesting a high \\nutilization efficiency of generated OH− ions. However, at high current densities, FEcarbonate  showed a slight decrease owing to the competition \\nbetween the rate of carbonate formation and OH− migration. There \\nwere sufficient CO2 molecules around the catalyst–membrane interface \\nat low current densities to react rapidly with the generated OH− ions \\nbefore they were transported across the membrane by means of car -\\nbonate ions form. For high ORR currents, a large number of OH− ions  \\nwere generated, depleting the surrounding CO2 molecules at a fast rate. \\nThis limits the mass diffusion of CO2 and allows some OH− ions to move \\ndirectly across the AEM without reacting with CO2 molecules, resulting \\nin lowered FEs. Even with lower FEcarbonate , our solid-electrolyte reactor \\ndelivered an impressive carbon-capture rate of 3.34\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2 (or \\n0.137\\u2009mmolCO2\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2) at 500\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, which is equivalent to a rate \\nof about 86.7\\u2009kg\\u2009CO2\\u2009day−1\\u2009m−2. According to the reaction mechanism \\ndiscussed above, we can anticipate that the maximal current density \\nrequired to maintain high FEs would decrease with decreasing CO2 \\nconcentrations in the input gas owing to limited mass diffusion.

Please note that \\nthe choice of ion conduction in the solid electrolyte plays a critical role \\nin determining the cell voltage, particularly under high current density  \\n(Supplementary Fig.\\xa011).\\nIn principle, because ORR catalysis and CO2 capture are independent \\nprocesses, the O2 partial pressure should only affect the cell activity and \\nnot its carbon-capture rates or FEs3,4. As shown by the I–V curve com-\\nparison in Fig.\\xa0 2e, the solid-electrolyte reactor with air\\u2009+\\u200913.9%\\u2009CO2 pre -\\nsented similar ORR/OER electrolysis activities to that of O2\\u2009+\\u200913.9%\\u2009CO2 \\nat low currents, but required higher voltages at higher currents owing \\nto its lower O2 partial pressure. However, this cell-voltage difference \\ndid not affect the current efficiencies or CO2-capture rates (Fig.\\xa0 2f and \\nSupplementary Figs.\\xa012 and 13). To further test the carbon-capture \\ncapability and adaptability of our solid-electrolyte device, we lowered \\nthe feed CO2 levels to 6,200 and 2,950\\u2009ppm while evaluating the cell \\nperformance (Supplementary Fig.\\xa014). At low CO2 concentrations, the \\nmain limitation to the carbon-capture rate is the mass transport of \\nCO2 from the inlet flow to the catalyst–membrane interface, which is \\na common challenge for scaling up of all carbon-capture methods. As \\nshown in Fig.\\xa0 2g, the CO2-capture efficiency was maintained above 80% \\nwithin the current range 1–10\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 but rapidly decreased to around \\n50–60% when reaching 20–30\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2. This FE decrease is because of \\nthe mass-transfer limit of CO2 gas under this low-concentration condi -\\ntion, which became more prominent when the input CO2 concentration \\nwas further reduced to 2,950\\u2009ppm (Fig.\\xa0 2h). In this case, the FEcarbonate  \\ndecreased to about 55% under 10\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 current compared with 90% \\nin the case of 6,200\\u2009ppm. The observed FE trends imply that the opera -\\ntional current of the carbon-capture cell can be adjusted to suit different \\napplication scenarios, depending on the input CO2 concentrations, \\nwhile still maintaining high electron efficiencies.\\nIn practical scenarios, CO impurities are widely present in industrial \\nflue gas owing to incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, which \\ncould greatly affect the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst because \\nof poisoning effects31,32. As shown in Fig.\\xa0 2i, the cell voltage under a \\nfixed current of 100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 showed an immediate increase when a CO \\nstream was mixed with the cathode gas input and continuously rose by \\nabout 300\\u2009mV within 10\\u2009h operation, suggesting a fast degradation of \\nPt/C ORR activity. The impurity poisoning effects on the Pt catalyst, as \\nwell as Pt scarcity and high cost, could limit the practical application \\nof our solid-electrolyte carbon-capture device.\\nThe impacts of different ORR catalysts\\nOne unique advantage of our carbon-capture device is the flexibility \\nin using different ORR and OER catalysts. Replacing the expensive \\nPt/C noble-metal catalyst with earth-abundant ORR catalysts can sub -\\nstantially reduce the materials cost; alternative ORR catalysts with \\ndifferent material properties could help mitigate the CO poisoning \\neffect observed on Pt/C. One promising candidate is the recently devel-\\noped transition-metal single-atom catalyst (SAC), such as Fe or Co \\nsingle-atomic sites coordinated in N-doped carbon33,34. These SACs \\npresented similar ORR performance to commercial Pt/C with high \\nresistance to CO poisoning owing to the weak interaction between CO \\nand the transition-metal centre35. Here we used Co-SAC as a representa -\\ntive ORR catalyst to investigate these possible advantages compared \\nwith Pt/C. Our Co-SAC was synthesized on the basis of a hard-template \\nmethod developed in our previous study, which guarantees high poros -\\nity and uniform distribution of metal single-atomic sites on the carbon \\nmatrix36 (Methods). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and \\nother characterization tools suggest an interconnected 3D porous \\nstructure of Co-SAC reversely templating from the SiO2 nanoparticle \\ntemplates (Fig.\\xa03a and Supplementary Figs.\\xa015–18). X-ray absorption \\nspectroscopy (XAS) confirmed the atomic dispersion of Co as shown in Fig.\\xa03b,c, in which only the Co–N coordination (located at around \\n1.4\\u2009Å) was observed in the spectrum and no Co–Co interactions (about \\n2.15\\u2009Å)37.\\nWe first evaluated the carbon-capture performance of our Co-SAC \\nunder a standard 13.9%\\u2009CO2 concentration. The I –V curve showed a \\nsimilar catalytic activity and FEcarbonate  compared with Pt/C catalyst \\n(Fig.\\xa03d and Supplementary Figs.\\xa019–21), suggesting the feasibility of \\nreplacing Pt/C noble-metal catalyst with earth-abundant materials. \\nDifferences became evident when we tuned the CO2 concentration \\nto 6,200\\u2009ppm, at which mass transport plays a more critical role in \\ndetermining carbon-capture performance. As shown in Fig.\\xa0 3e, the \\nCo-SAC maintained a high FE of more than 80% until 20\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, \\nunder which the Pt/C counterpart only achieved roughly 60% FE. \\nThe carbon-capture rate of Co-SAC was 0.12\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2 under \\n20\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, suggesting a more than 30% improvement compared with \\nPt/C (about 0.09\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2). The improvement ratio was further \\nenhanced to around 50% under 30\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2. Our Co-SAC can deliver \\n40\\u2009mA\\u2009m−2 current density with 60% FE and a carbon-capture rate of \\n0.18\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2 or 4.8\\u2009kgCO2\\u2009day−1\\u2009m−2, suggesting a highly efficient \\ncarbon capture considering this low-CO2-concentration source. Differ -\\nent from Pt/C catalyst with the active sites densely packed on the surface \\nof Pt nanoparticles, Co-SAC has uniformly dispersed active sites across \\nthe whole carbon matrix, which enables a more uniform generation of \\nOH− ions for a more efficient CO2 capture, especially when the CO2 mass \\ndiffusion is limited (Supplementary Fig.\\xa022). We further explored our \\nCo-SAC and PSE device carbon-capture limit by testing its direct air \\ncapture (DAC) performance (400\\u2009ppm CO2; Methods). As expected, the \\nORR current density to maintain high FEcarbonate  was decreased because \\nof the limited carbon mass diffusions under DAC conditions (Supple-\\nmentary Fig.\\xa023). Our reactor delivered almost 100% FEcarbonate  under \\na 0.5\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 ORR current. This represents a carbon-capture rate of \\n1.14\\u2009mg\\u2009m−2\\u2009s−1, comparable with the state-of-the-art DAC demonstra-\\ntion of about 1\\u2009mg\\u2009m−2\\u2009s−1(ref.\\u200938). Future improvements, including \\nlower-cost catalysts, electrodes and ion-exchange membranes, are \\nneeded to justify the scalability of our PSE reactor for DAC application \\nwhen compared with decoupled electrochemical/chemical reactions, \\nin which electrolysis could be operated under high current densities. \\nOur mass-transport simulation model and further DAC experiments \\non the impacts of pressure and catalyst-layer thickness lay the ground -\\nwork for different tuning knobs to enhance the device performance in \\nthe future (Supplementary Discussion\\xa01, Supplementary Table\\xa01 and \\nSupplementary Figs.\\xa024 and 25).\\nThe CO injection experiment shown in Fig.\\xa0 3f suggests the high \\nresistance of our Co-SAC to CO poisoning resulting from the weak \\ninteractions between the metal single-atomic sites and CO molecules32. \\nNo notable changes were observed in the cell voltage and FEs (>90%) when CO or other toxic gas (such as NO and SO\\n2) was injected into the \\ninput gas stream (Supplementary Fig.\\xa026). The potential for practical \\ncarbon-capture application was further demonstrated by the high \\nstability of Co-SAC in our solid-electrolyte device (Fig.\\xa03g and Sup -\\nplementary Figs.\\xa027 and 28), in which the cell voltage and FE remained \\nunchanged during the 72-h continuous carbon-capture operation \\nunder a fixed current density of 100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2.\\nTo make our study more practical, instead of using the above CO2–O2  \\nor CO2–air mixtures, we prepared simulated flue gas (13.9%\\u2009CO2, 7.8%\\u2009O2, \\n76.3%\\u2009N2 and 2.0%\\u2009H2O) as the gas input to our solid-electrolyte device. \\nA tandem reactor system, with two identical solid-electrolyte cells but \\noperated under two-stage current densities, was designed to deliver \\nboth high carbon-removal efficiencies and high FEs (Fig.\\xa0 3h).

We would like to emphasize \\nthat the PSE is an indispensable part of our carbon-capture device even \\nwith an ultrathin middle layer (Supplementary Fig.\\xa032).\\nSecond, the carbon-crossover efficiencies can be improved by means \\nof the formation of different types of anion. As discussed above, we \\nbelieve that the carbon crossover is through the carbonate ions, which \\nrequire two-electron transfer per captured CO2 molecule (0.5\\u2009CO2 per e−).  \\nOne possible alternative to improving the electron efficiency is estab -\\nlishing the CO2–H2O2 equilibrium42. Similar to the CO2–OH− reaction in \\nthe water system, CO2 can readily react with the HO2− anion from H2O2 \\nto form percarbonate (HCO4−)42. If we replace the 4e−-ORR catalyst in \\nour solid-electrolyte reactor with a 2e−-ORR catalyst7, we may obtain a \\nmaximal 50% increase in electron efficiencies. With every two-electron \\ntransfer, one OH− and one HO2− could form, which can transport 1.5\\u2009CO2 \\ngas molecules across the AEM (0.75\\u2009CO2 per e−; Fig.\\xa0 4d). To validate this \\nhypothesis, we used the Ni-SAC with a reasonable H2O2 selectivity in our \\nsolid-electrolyte reactor for carbon-capture tests (Fig.\\xa0 4e and Supple -\\nmentary Figs.\\xa033–36). As shown in Fig.\\xa0 4f, the carbon-capture rates on \\nNi-SAC suggested a notable increase compared with 4e−-ORR catalysts \\ndemonstrated above. Under 100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 current density, the 4e−-ORR \\ncatalyst presented a carbon-capture rate of around 0.7\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2, \\nwhereas the Ni-SAC delivered a rate of 1.05\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2. The increased \\ncarbon-capture rates were carefully confirmed by excluding the pos-\\nsibility of O2 gas bubbles from H2O2 self-decomposition in the PSE \\nlayer or any impacts of H2O2 on titrations (Supplementary Discus -\\nsion\\xa02 and Supplementary Figs.\\xa037 and 38). By calculating the number \\nof CO2 molecules captured per electron transferred, instead of using \\nthe above-defined FEcarbonate  resulting from the multianion crossover \\nmechanism involved, a promising 0.71\\u2009CO2 per e− was achieved under \\n100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, compared with 0.47\\u2009CO2 per e− in the case of 4e−-ORR \\n(Fig.\\xa0 4f). Using other 2e−-ORR catalysts, including oxidized carbon \\nblack (OCB) and Fe-SAC (Supplementary Figs.\\xa039 and 40), we showed \\nthat the carbon-capture electron efficiency linearly scales with H2O2 \\nselectivity under the same current density, further demonstrating the \\nimprovement of HO2− ions in transporting CO2 molecules (Fig.\\xa0 4g). We \\ncan also exclude the possibility of bicarbonate crossover in the case of \\nH2O2, which could also improve the electron efficiencies (Supplemen -\\ntary Discussion\\xa03).\\nThe improvements in cell voltages and electron efficiencies dis -\\ncussed above can further reduce the carbon-capture cost of our device.  \\nA techno-economic analysis based on previously reported models and \\nthe performance of our device (Figs.\\xa02  and 3 ) suggests a base cost of \\nabout $83 per ton of captured CO2 (refs.\\u200943 ,44) (Fig.\\xa0 4h, Supplemen -\\ntary Fig.\\xa041, Supplementary Discussion\\xa04 and Supplementary Table\\xa02).  \\nBy taking into consideration the demonstrated improvements, \\nincluding a thinner PSE layer (Fig.\\xa0 4b) and higher electron efficien -\\ncies (Fig.\\xa04f ), the estimated cost can be reduced to about $58 per ton \\nand can be more attractive if the value of generated H2O2 was included. \\nConsidering this very initial study with each component to be further \\nimproved and optimized in future research, our solid-electrolyte \\ncarbon-capture reactor represents a competitive, promising and sus-\\ntainable strategy for carbon management. For example, we can switch \\nto other facile redox couples in different application scenarios, such \\nas hydrogen evolution reaction/hydrogen oxidation reaction (HER/\\nHOR) or organic and inorganic molecular redox couples, to further \\nreduce the overpotentials. Further improvements of the ohmic drops \\nof the reactor can be expected with a thinner middle layer and more \\nconductive solid-electrolyte particles. Other operation parameters, \\nsuch as temperature for better reaction kinetics and pressure for bet-\\nter mass transport, could also be implemented for different appli -\\ncation scenarios (Supplementary Figs.\\xa042 and 43). The mentioned \\nimprovements could bring the carbon-capture cost down to about  \\n$33 per ton.Conclusion\\nGiven various electrochemical redox reactions available with proton–\\nelectron coupling processes (HER/HOR, quinone redox couples, flow \\nbattery redox couples and so on), our solid-electrolyte reactor sets \\nup a versatile carbon-capture platform that could be implemented \\nin many practical scenarios in the future. It is worth noting that many \\nelectrochemical redox couples, such as HER/HOR, present much better \\nreaction kinetics and lower overpotentials than the OER/ORR cou -\\nple we demonstrated in this work, which can substantially reduce the \\ncell-operation voltage and improve the carbon-capture efficiencies. \\nVarious cell and operation parameters, such as the thickness of the \\nsolid-electrolyte layer, operation temperature and pressure, redox cou -\\nple catalyst improvements and reaction pathway tuning, can be further \\noptimized as future research directions to improve the carbon-capture \\nenergy efficiencies and costs for practical deployments.\\nOnline content\\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summa -\\nries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowl -\\nedgements, peer review information; details of author contributions \\nand competing interests; and statements of data and code availability \\nare available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06060-1.\\n1.

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone–hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35\\xa0nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520\\xa0mV at a current density of 10\\xa0mA\\xa0cm−2, comparable to 530\\xa0mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90\\xa0mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications. To study the interface, thin films of a PPy/[Sn(dmit)3]2 were electrochemically grown with the aid of a microcell typically used in scanning tunneling microscopy assays. Raman and FTIR spectroscopies showed the effect of dimensionality on those materials, especially on the vibrational modes of dmit ring and on the 75\\xa0nm thick PPy/[Sn (dmit)3]2 film, which presents an optimized polymer chain conjunction length and a 20\\xa0% greater contribution to the polaron charge carriers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed the polaron/bipolaron ratio data, allowing us to determine other contributions to the surface charge density. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images show the hybrid thin film's different growth modes and the roughness evolution as a function of the electrochemical signal used in the synthesis.Acetylcholinesterase modified inkjet-printed graphene/gold nanoparticle/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) hybrid electrode for ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection2023, BioelectrochemistryShow abstractThis study successfully created a portable acetylcholinesterase sensor on a printed hybrid electrode capable of detecting chlorpyrifos in the field. While a screen-printed electrode was chosen herein to enable a single-use and portable platform for the in-field application, the hybrid material was incorporated to ensure ultrasensitive detection at lower electrode potentials. The hybrid ink of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated on graphene (GP) sheets in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was synthesized through a simple completely-green one-pot process. The subsequent characterization was carried out via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The synergy resulting from the greater surface area and enhanced transfer of electrons combined with high levels of electrocatalytic activity and superb conductivity offered by GP, AuNP, and PEDOT:PSS allows the sensor to exhibit ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection at the relatively low detection limit of 0.07\\xa0nM. The sensor demonstrated in this study also exhibits good reproducibility, desirable stability, and a successful application for the real sample with satisfactory recovery results of around 106\\xa0%, indicating its potential for use as a tool in the analysis of pesticides.Enzyme based bioelectrocatalysis over laccase immobilized poly-thiophene supported carbon fiber paper for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone2022, Molecular CatalysisShow abstractA modified electrode based on laccase immobilized poly-thiophene-3-carboxylic acid supported on carbon fiber paper was developed for the electrocatalytic oxidation of D-ribofuranose to otherwise difficult-to-access D-ribonolactone, a precursor for C-nucleoside based drug like Remdesivir. The electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuranose was achieved by the TEMPO-mediated electrochemical process. The experimental parameters were optimized and validated using Design of Experiment (DoE) statistical tool indicating the concentration of TEMPO and stirring as important parameters in bulk electrolysis. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuronose followed single electron anodic oxidation of TEMPO mediated by laccase to the corresponding oxoammonium nitrosonium species which was vital for the mediated electrochemical oxidation. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation was established using cyclic voltammetry and computational studies. The plausible interactions of laccase enzyme with TEMPO mediator were studied using molecular docking experiments. This facile method was successfully applied for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone.Electropolymerized melamine for simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine2020, Food ChemistryShow abstractPoly(melamine) (PMel) was synthesized via the electropolymerization of melamine monomer, which was then characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The possible polymerization mechanisms of melamine were also revealed by FT-IR spectroscopy and UV–Vis spectroscopy. Next, the PMel modified GCE (PMel/GCE) was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite (NO2−) and tartrazine, and the parameters were optimized. The kinetic study showed that the electrochemical oxidation of nitrite and tartrazine at the surface of PMel/GCE is a typical surface-controlled electrode process. Under the optimun conditions, the developed sensor outperformed those previously reported, and it also exhibited high selectivity and reproducibility. Finally, the PMel/GCE was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine in foodstuffs, and the results indicated that the proposed sensor could be a promising candidate for accurate determination of nitrite and tartrazine in real food samples.The role of electrolytically deposited palladium and platinum metal nanoparticles dispersed onto poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene) for enhanced glucose electrooxidation in biofuel cells2020, Electrochimica ActaShow abstractGlucose biofuel cells are one of the promising power supplies with a competent long-term stability and power density. In this respect, catalysts of palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) metal nanoparticles film coated electrode were fabricated for biofuel cell. The Pt and Pd particles were electrochemically deposited onto glassy carbon (GC) electrode modified with poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene), (p-1,8-DAN), via single or layer-by-layer electrodeposition. In results, Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC and Pd-Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC shell-core catalysts were fabricated and characterized by several analytical techniques such as AFM, EDX,SEM, TEM, and XPS, in addition to electrochemical methods. Their catalytic electrooxidation behaviors of glucose were investigated in alkaline medium. The as-prepared nano-catalysts showed improved electrocatalytic performances and better stability for glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) due to the presence of metal nanoparticles. The Pd as core and Pt as shell in Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC catalyst exhibited higher electrochemically accessible surface area (157.58 m2/g) and a favored electrooxidation efficiency. Moreover, the bimetallic Pt-Pd shell-core electrode showed higher resistance to poisoning (tolerance 1.24) and a decrease in the onset potential to -0.28\\xa0V. These multipurpose electro-catalysts are a potential candidate for developing a novel glucose biofuel cell.View all citing articles on ScopusResearch articleRecent advances in the synthesis of conducting polymers from the vapour phaseProgress in Materials Science, Volume 86, 2017, pp. 127-146Show abstractInherently conducting polymers (ICPs) combine the electrical properties of metals and semiconductors with a polymer’s ability to flex and/or stretch. In general, polymers are relatively simple to synthesise, however, ICPs themselves have had limited uptake in consumer devices. This lack of uptake is in part related to the insolubility of many ICPs in common industrial solvents, and hence methods to manufacture them in a usable form have been problematic. Vapour phase polymerisation (VPP) is one method that provides a convenient route to producing thin films of both soluble and insoluble ICPs, and nanocomposites thereof. In this critical review the VPP process will be discussed from the fundamental viewpoint of the proposed polymerisation mechanism and the parameters affecting polymer growth for a range of different monomers (thiophene, 3-hexylthiophene, pyrrole, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, etc.). Looking forward into the future, new areas of polymer design and fabrication using VPP will be discussed, such as the enhancement of ICPs through additives, and next generation device fabrication based upon VPP ICPs.Research articleConducting polymeric nanocomposites: A review in solar fuel applicationsFuel, Volume 325, 2022, Article 124899Show abstractOver the last few decades, research is being carried out in the field of photocatalysis to investigate for fuels production in sustainable manner. Due to an energy depletion and CO2 emission in the current situation urge us to produce alternative fuels. Water splitting and the reduction of carbon dioxide using various photocatalysts are being developed as promising sustainable methods to obtain eco-friendly energy sources. Conducting polymers (CP) stand out among the current pool of studied photocatalysts due to their high light absorption efficiency, good stability, tunable electronic characteristics, and cost effectiveness. Various CP, such as polyaniline, polythiophene, and polypyrrole have been integrated with different semiconducting nanomaterials to produce photocatalytic composites. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the synthesis of CP and their nanocomposites for application in CO2 photoreduction and water splitting into fuel production using different polymeric composites. Many composite photocatalysts show synergistic effects between the polymeric material and other counterparts in the composite. The improvement in the inactivity of the composite can be attributed to the band configurations of the composite. Improving the separation of excitons, widening the light absorption region, enhancing the substrate adsorption, and preventing photocorrosion conductive polymers can significantly increase the photocatalytic activity under visible light. The addition of conducting polymers with an inorganic materials dramatically change their band positions and may reduce the possiblilty of electron hole recombination. Here, we explain by what means conductive polymeric material can improve the efficiency of the composite in an organized manner, thereby providing a comprehensive reference to the field. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of polymeric catalysts have been discussed briefly.Research articlePolyaniline/polyvinyl alcohol blends: Effect of sulfonic acid dopants on microstructural, optical, thermal and electrical propertiesSynthetic Metals, Volume 191, 2014, pp. 126-134Show abstractThis correspondence reports the preparation and performance of different polyaniline–polyvinyl blends (PANI–PVA) doped with sulfonated acids. PANI is prepared by in situ dispersion polymerisation, and a subsequent extensive study determines the effect of protonation upon doping with four different types of acids. We obtain the blends by changing the four different dopants, viz. β-naphtalenesulfonic acid (NSA), camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) and p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA), while maintaining constant PANI and PVA concentrations. The polymer thin films are deposited on glass substrates by the dip-cast procedure. Lastly, the films of the obtained blends are characterised by surface, structural morphology (elemental analysis, AFM, SEM, FTIR and XRD), thermal properties (TGA and DSC) and UV–vis spectroscopy. The morphological analysis shows that the nanoparticles form different shapes, which depend on the type of dopant, whereas the FTIR spectra show the chemical interaction between the two polymers. The thermal study reveals three-step degradation of the polymer blends. To confirm the possible use of these blends in the electrical industry, the electrical properties are studied by in-plane I–V characteristics and four probe conductivity measurements.Research articleIntrinsically conducting polymers in electrochemical energy technology: Trends and progressElectrochimica Acta, Volume 122, 2014, pp. 93-107Show abstractThe use of intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) like polythiophene (PTh), polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) in devices and systems for electrochemical energy storage and conversion is briefly reviewed with a focus on an overview distinguishing between already established uses and potential applications. Basic principles in these three major fields are highlighted:•ICPs as active masses.•ICPs as conductance-enhancing additives.•ICPs as auxiliary materials beyond conductance.Research articleMultifunctional electrocatalysts derived from conducting polymer and metal organic framework complexesNano Energy, Volume 45, 2018, pp. 127-135Show abstractHigh cost, scarcity, and detrimental environmental effect of the noble-metal based catalysts have prompted the seek of less expensive, more benign, and earth abundant substitutes for energy conversion and storage. Here, we demonstrate a novel multifunctional electrocatalyst constructed by pyrolysis of the complex of polyaniline (PANI) and metal organic framework [Co-based MOF; zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67)]. The resultant PANI/ZIF-67 complex unveiled excellent electrocatalytic activities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. It was found that the catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 complex towards ORR, OER and HER could be tuned by simple changing the weight ratio of PANI to the MOF. Further, we tested the material as an air electrode for a primary zinc-air battery, demonstrating an open-circuit potential of 1.42\\xa0V and a peak power density of ~ 45\\xa0mW\\xa0cm−2 - both are superior to those of its counterpart of the Pt/C air-electrode. The excellent multifunctional catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 are mainly attributed to the synergistic combination of cobalt nanoparticles, Co3O4, and nitrogen doped carbon from the PANI/ZIF-67 complex after pyrolysis.Research articleProtective polymeric films for industrial substrates: A critical review on past and recent applications with conducting polymers and polymer composites/nanocompositesProgress in Materials Science, Volume 104, 2019, pp. 380-450Show abstractCorrosion defined as the deterioration of a material when it interacts with its environment is a global problem. Among the different strategies employed to combat corrosion, the use of coatings and corrosion inhibitors are the most popular. Coatings or corrosion inhibitors form a layer over the metallic substrate and protect it against corrosion. Polymers, both naturally occurring and synthetic have been tested for metal corrosion protection as replacement for the toxic inorganic and organic corrosion inhibitors. Interest in them stems from their availability, cost effectiveness, and eco-friendliness (especially for natural polymers) in addition to the inherent stability and multiple adsorption centers. However, it is found that most polymeric materials studied are moderate corrosion inhibitors. Several attempts such as copolymerization, addition of substances that exert synergistic effect, cross linking, blending, and most recently incorporation of inorganic substances in nano size into the polymer matrix have been made to improve the inhibition ability of polymers. In this review, the application of conducting polymers, polymer composites and nanocomposites for corrosion protection of different industrial metal substrates are explored based on reported experimental data and their mechanism of inhibition explained. Some identified drawbacks and future direction in this area have also been highlighted.View full textCopyright © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\\nTerms & Conditions\\nMost electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.

Here we demonstrate a continuous \\nelectrochemical carbon-capture design by coupling oxygen/water (O2/H2O) redox \\ncouple with a modular solid-electrolyte reactor7. By performing oxygen reduction \\nreaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) redox electrolysis, our device can efficiently absorb dilute carbon dioxide (CO\\n2) molecules at the high-alkaline \\ncathode–membrane interface to form carbonate ions, followed by a neutralization process through the proton flux from the anode to continuously output a high-purity \\n(>99%) CO\\n2 stream from the middle solid-electrolyte layer. No chemical inputs were \\nneeded nor side products generated during the whole carbon absorption/release \\nprocess. High carbon-capture rates (440\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, 0.137\\u2009mmolCO2\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2 or \\n86.7\\u2009kgCO2\\u2009day−1\\u2009m−2), high Faradaic efficiencies (>90% based on carbonate), high \\ncarbon-removal efficiency (>98%) in simulated flue gas and low energy consumption (starting from about 150\\u2009kJ per mol\\nCO2) were demonstrated in our carbon-capture \\nsolid-electrolyte reactor, suggesting promising practical applications.\\nCO2 capture from dilute sources, ranging from industrial waste gas \\nto atmosphere, plays an increasingly important role in managing \\nglobal CO2 emissions and promoting downstream CO2 storage and \\nuse1,3,8,9. Existing carbon-capture technologies (such as the amine \\nscrubbing and Ca(OH)2/CaCO3/CaO+CO2 cycling process) typically \\nrely on an energy-intensive and centralized thermal cycling process, \\nin which elevated temperatures (as high as 900\\u2009°C in the case of CaCO3 \\ndecomposition) are needed to release the absorbed CO2 (refs.\\u200910 –12). \\nOther carbon-capture methods that use solid sorbents with high \\nporosity and surface area, such as metal–organic frameworks, have \\nshown promising capture capacities but inferior cycling stability, \\nespecially when exposed to humidity13– 15. Although electrochemical \\ncarbon-capture methods have gained attention as appealing alterna -\\ntives owing to their high energy efficiency, decentralized operation, \\nambient reaction conditions and ability to use renewable electricity, \\nsubstantial challenges must be addressed before they can be widely \\nimplemented3–5,16–18.\\nIn general, electrochemical carbon capture relies on either \\nredox-active carriers or pH swing to absorb and release CO2. The \\nredox-active carriers, such as quinones, have high energy efficiency \\nowing to their facile reaction kinetics involved in binding and releasing \\nCO2 molecules under reduced and oxidized states19,20. However, their \\npractical applications are still limited by low capture rates (typically \\n<10\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2) and sensitivity to O2 gas present in most CO2 sources. On \\nthe other hand, pH-swing methods using salt or water electrolysis to separate alkaline and acidic solutions, for CO2 absorption followed by \\nacidification to release CO2, have been reported to be insensitive to O2 \\nand can deliver larger currents (about 100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2)2,18 ,21,22. However, \\nthe decoupling of the electrolysis process from the CO2 absorption \\nprocess requires energy-intensive downstream gas–liquid contacting \\nprocesses, especially under low CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, \\nby-products such as H2 (from water splitting)23 or Cl2 (from NaCl elec-\\ntrolysis)24,25 generated in different pH-swing designs add complexity \\nand challenges to decentralized carbon capture.\\nHere we report a different carbon-capture design by coupling O2/\\nH2O electrolysis with our porous solid-electrolyte (PSE) reactor7 for a \\ncontinuous and modular CO2 capture from a wide range of CO2 sources \\nat industrially relevant capture rate, high energy efficiency, no O2 sen -\\nsitivity and easy scalability and adaptability. As shown in Fig.\\xa01a, our \\nsolid-electrolyte reactor comprises an ORR (O2\\u2009+\\u20092H2O\\u2009+\\u20094e−\\u2009=\\u20094OH−) \\ncathode and an OER (2H2O\\u2009=\\u2009O2\\u2009+\\u20094H+\\u2009+\\u20094e−) anode, which are sepa -\\nrated by a compact, but porous, solid-electrolyte layer to allow effi -\\ncient ion conduction (Supplementary Fig.\\xa01). By performing this OER/\\nORR redox electrolysis, the system does not consume or produce any \\nchemicals, as the generated O2 from the anode can be recycled back \\nto the cathode for a stoichiometric balance.

These carbonate ions, driven by the electric field, then \\nmigrate across the AEM into the PSE layer. Meanwhile, water on the \\nanode side is oxidized to generate the same amount of O2 that gets \\nconsumed and releases protons (H+) that travel across the CEM into \\nthe middle layer to compensate the charge. These crossover carbonate \\nand proton ions are recombined to form CO2 gas again, which can be \\ncontinuously pushed out and collected in its high-purity form through \\na recycling water flow through the PSE layer (Fig.\\xa0 1c).\\nOur solid-electrolyte carbon-capture design presents several advan -\\ntages over reported electrochemical carbon-capture methods. First, \\nunlike some redox-active carriers that can be poisoned by the coexist -\\ning O2 gas6, our proposed system fully uses O2 through ORR to create \\na strong interfacial alkaline environment for effective CO2 capture26. \\nSecond, there are no specific chemical inputs (other than water) or \\nconsumption during the capture process, as the device performs ORR/\\nOER redox electrolysis. Third, the triple-phase boundary created at \\nthe cathode of our solid-electrolyte reactor allows for rapid diffu -\\nsion of CO2 in the gas phase towards the catalyst–membrane inter -\\nface26–28, enabling the reactor to operate under large current densities \\nfor fast CO2 capture while still maintaining high Faradaic efficiencies. \\nThis is different from the traditional pH-swing method, in which the \\nliquid-phase mass diffusion limits the rates of CO2 adsorption (through \\ngas–liquid contact). Fourth, the capture system can take advantage \\nof past advancements in fuel cells and water-splitting catalysts for \\nhigh energy efficiencies and easy scalability. Finally, our PSE device \\nenables a continuous, simultaneous and integrated carbon-capture \\nand release process, which differs from traditional absorption/desorp -\\ntion cycles and simplifies the carbon-capture system for many on-site \\napplications (Fig.\\xa0 1d).Concept verification\\nTo validate the proposed CO2-capture mechanism, we used commercial \\nPt/C and IrO2 as the electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, respectively29. \\nDifferent CO2:O2 ratios were used to establish a fundamental under -\\nstanding of the intrinsic CO2-separation performance of the system \\n(Methods and Supplementary Figs.\\xa02 and 3). As shown in Fig.\\xa02a, the \\nORR/OER I–V curves under different CO2 concentrations were similar, \\nsuggesting that the O2 concentration instead of the CO2 concentration \\ndetermines the cell activity. The onset potential (under 0.5\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2) \\nis around 0.8\\u2009V, including OER and ORR overpotentials (around 200–\\n300\\u2009mV each), ohmic drops and pH overpotentials during electrolysis3. \\nUnder high current density, at which O2 mass diffusion starts to affect \\nORR activity, the I –V curve (without iR compensations; Supplementary \\nFig.\\xa04) of 4.6%\\u2009CO2 showed slightly better cell voltage than that of 8.6% \\nor 13.9% owing to its higher O2 partial pressure.\\nUnder a constant ORR/OER electrolysis current, we can obtain the \\nCO2-capture rate, which is equivalent to the CO2 crossover rate, by meas -\\nuring the CO2 flow rate out of the PSE layer using water-displacement \\nand titration methods for both the gas-phase and dissolved CO2 \\n(Methods and Supplementary Figs.\\xa05–7). This CO2 dissolution can be \\navoided in practical operations by continuously recycling the deion -\\nized water stream. The CO2 bubble formation within the PSE layer \\nwas found to have little impact on the middle-layer pressure or the \\ndevice operational stability (Supplementary Fig.\\xa08). Furthermore, the \\nrecovered gas product was confirmed to be high-purity CO2 through \\ngas chromatography analysis (up to 99.7% without considering water \\nvapour; Supplementary Fig.\\xa09), allowing for direct integration with \\ndownstream utilization or storage processes without the typical \\nenergy-intensive secondary purification processes.

As shown in Fig.\\xa02b , with 13.9%\\u2009CO2 \\nconcentration, the CO2-capture rate increased almost linearly with the \\nORR current density ranging from 10 to 500\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2. By estimating the \\nslope of the CO2-capture (or crossover) rate as a function of the ORR \\ncurrent, we found that, for every two-electron transfer during which \\ntwo OH− ions were generated, there was one CO2 molecule captured, \\nsuggesting that the CO2 crossover is mainly through the carbonate ion \\ninstead of bicarbonate because of the high local interfacial pH. This \\nconclusion is supported by the well-matched CO2-capture rates with \\nthe theoretical guideline, which assumes 100% carbonate crossover \\nand is consistent with observations reported in previous studies5,16,18,30. \\nTherefore, here we defined the carbonate Faradaic efficiency (FEcarbon -\\nate) to better evaluate the carbon-capture efficiencies under different \\nreaction conditions (Methods). The FEcarbonate  was maintained over 90% \\nacross a wide range of cell currents under 13.9%\\u2009CO2, suggesting a high \\nutilization efficiency of generated OH− ions. However, at high current densities, FEcarbonate  showed a slight decrease owing to the competition \\nbetween the rate of carbonate formation and OH− migration. There \\nwere sufficient CO2 molecules around the catalyst–membrane interface \\nat low current densities to react rapidly with the generated OH− ions \\nbefore they were transported across the membrane by means of car -\\nbonate ions form. For high ORR currents, a large number of OH− ions  \\nwere generated, depleting the surrounding CO2 molecules at a fast rate. \\nThis limits the mass diffusion of CO2 and allows some OH− ions to move \\ndirectly across the AEM without reacting with CO2 molecules, resulting \\nin lowered FEs. Even with lower FEcarbonate , our solid-electrolyte reactor \\ndelivered an impressive carbon-capture rate of 3.34\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2 (or \\n0.137\\u2009mmolCO2\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2) at 500\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, which is equivalent to a rate \\nof about 86.7\\u2009kg\\u2009CO2\\u2009day−1\\u2009m−2. According to the reaction mechanism \\ndiscussed above, we can anticipate that the maximal current density \\nrequired to maintain high FEs would decrease with decreasing CO2 \\nconcentrations in the input gas owing to limited mass diffusion.

Please note that \\nthe choice of ion conduction in the solid electrolyte plays a critical role \\nin determining the cell voltage, particularly under high current density  \\n(Supplementary Fig.\\xa011).\\nIn principle, because ORR catalysis and CO2 capture are independent \\nprocesses, the O2 partial pressure should only affect the cell activity and \\nnot its carbon-capture rates or FEs3,4. As shown by the I–V curve com-\\nparison in Fig.\\xa0 2e, the solid-electrolyte reactor with air\\u2009+\\u200913.9%\\u2009CO2 pre -\\nsented similar ORR/OER electrolysis activities to that of O2\\u2009+\\u200913.9%\\u2009CO2 \\nat low currents, but required higher voltages at higher currents owing \\nto its lower O2 partial pressure. However, this cell-voltage difference \\ndid not affect the current efficiencies or CO2-capture rates (Fig.\\xa0 2f and \\nSupplementary Figs.\\xa012 and 13). To further test the carbon-capture \\ncapability and adaptability of our solid-electrolyte device, we lowered \\nthe feed CO2 levels to 6,200 and 2,950\\u2009ppm while evaluating the cell \\nperformance (Supplementary Fig.\\xa014). At low CO2 concentrations, the \\nmain limitation to the carbon-capture rate is the mass transport of \\nCO2 from the inlet flow to the catalyst–membrane interface, which is \\na common challenge for scaling up of all carbon-capture methods. As \\nshown in Fig.\\xa0 2g, the CO2-capture efficiency was maintained above 80% \\nwithin the current range 1–10\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 but rapidly decreased to around \\n50–60% when reaching 20–30\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2. This FE decrease is because of \\nthe mass-transfer limit of CO2 gas under this low-concentration condi -\\ntion, which became more prominent when the input CO2 concentration \\nwas further reduced to 2,950\\u2009ppm (Fig.\\xa0 2h). In this case, the FEcarbonate  \\ndecreased to about 55% under 10\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 current compared with 90% \\nin the case of 6,200\\u2009ppm. The observed FE trends imply that the opera -\\ntional current of the carbon-capture cell can be adjusted to suit different \\napplication scenarios, depending on the input CO2 concentrations, \\nwhile still maintaining high electron efficiencies.\\nIn practical scenarios, CO impurities are widely present in industrial \\nflue gas owing to incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, which \\ncould greatly affect the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst because \\nof poisoning effects31,32. As shown in Fig.\\xa0 2i, the cell voltage under a \\nfixed current of 100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 showed an immediate increase when a CO \\nstream was mixed with the cathode gas input and continuously rose by \\nabout 300\\u2009mV within 10\\u2009h operation, suggesting a fast degradation of \\nPt/C ORR activity. The impurity poisoning effects on the Pt catalyst, as \\nwell as Pt scarcity and high cost, could limit the practical application \\nof our solid-electrolyte carbon-capture device.\\nThe impacts of different ORR catalysts\\nOne unique advantage of our carbon-capture device is the flexibility \\nin using different ORR and OER catalysts. Replacing the expensive \\nPt/C noble-metal catalyst with earth-abundant ORR catalysts can sub -\\nstantially reduce the materials cost; alternative ORR catalysts with \\ndifferent material properties could help mitigate the CO poisoning \\neffect observed on Pt/C. One promising candidate is the recently devel-\\noped transition-metal single-atom catalyst (SAC), such as Fe or Co \\nsingle-atomic sites coordinated in N-doped carbon33,34. These SACs \\npresented similar ORR performance to commercial Pt/C with high \\nresistance to CO poisoning owing to the weak interaction between CO \\nand the transition-metal centre35. Here we used Co-SAC as a representa -\\ntive ORR catalyst to investigate these possible advantages compared \\nwith Pt/C. Our Co-SAC was synthesized on the basis of a hard-template \\nmethod developed in our previous study, which guarantees high poros -\\nity and uniform distribution of metal single-atomic sites on the carbon \\nmatrix36 (Methods). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and \\nother characterization tools suggest an interconnected 3D porous \\nstructure of Co-SAC reversely templating from the SiO2 nanoparticle \\ntemplates (Fig.\\xa03a and Supplementary Figs.\\xa015–18). X-ray absorption \\nspectroscopy (XAS) confirmed the atomic dispersion of Co as shown in Fig.\\xa03b,c, in which only the Co–N coordination (located at around \\n1.4\\u2009Å) was observed in the spectrum and no Co–Co interactions (about \\n2.15\\u2009Å)37.\\nWe first evaluated the carbon-capture performance of our Co-SAC \\nunder a standard 13.9%\\u2009CO2 concentration. The I –V curve showed a \\nsimilar catalytic activity and FEcarbonate  compared with Pt/C catalyst \\n(Fig.\\xa03d and Supplementary Figs.\\xa019–21), suggesting the feasibility of \\nreplacing Pt/C noble-metal catalyst with earth-abundant materials. \\nDifferences became evident when we tuned the CO2 concentration \\nto 6,200\\u2009ppm, at which mass transport plays a more critical role in \\ndetermining carbon-capture performance. As shown in Fig.\\xa0 3e, the \\nCo-SAC maintained a high FE of more than 80% until 20\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, \\nunder which the Pt/C counterpart only achieved roughly 60% FE. \\nThe carbon-capture rate of Co-SAC was 0.12\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2 under \\n20\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, suggesting a more than 30% improvement compared with \\nPt/C (about 0.09\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2). The improvement ratio was further \\nenhanced to around 50% under 30\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2. Our Co-SAC can deliver \\n40\\u2009mA\\u2009m−2 current density with 60% FE and a carbon-capture rate of \\n0.18\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2 or 4.8\\u2009kgCO2\\u2009day−1\\u2009m−2, suggesting a highly efficient \\ncarbon capture considering this low-CO2-concentration source. Differ -\\nent from Pt/C catalyst with the active sites densely packed on the surface \\nof Pt nanoparticles, Co-SAC has uniformly dispersed active sites across \\nthe whole carbon matrix, which enables a more uniform generation of \\nOH− ions for a more efficient CO2 capture, especially when the CO2 mass \\ndiffusion is limited (Supplementary Fig.\\xa022). We further explored our \\nCo-SAC and PSE device carbon-capture limit by testing its direct air \\ncapture (DAC) performance (400\\u2009ppm CO2; Methods). As expected, the \\nORR current density to maintain high FEcarbonate  was decreased because \\nof the limited carbon mass diffusions under DAC conditions (Supple-\\nmentary Fig.\\xa023). Our reactor delivered almost 100% FEcarbonate  under \\na 0.5\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 ORR current. This represents a carbon-capture rate of \\n1.14\\u2009mg\\u2009m−2\\u2009s−1, comparable with the state-of-the-art DAC demonstra-\\ntion of about 1\\u2009mg\\u2009m−2\\u2009s−1(ref.\\u200938). Future improvements, including \\nlower-cost catalysts, electrodes and ion-exchange membranes, are \\nneeded to justify the scalability of our PSE reactor for DAC application \\nwhen compared with decoupled electrochemical/chemical reactions, \\nin which electrolysis could be operated under high current densities. \\nOur mass-transport simulation model and further DAC experiments \\non the impacts of pressure and catalyst-layer thickness lay the ground -\\nwork for different tuning knobs to enhance the device performance in \\nthe future (Supplementary Discussion\\xa01, Supplementary Table\\xa01 and \\nSupplementary Figs.\\xa024 and 25).\\nThe CO injection experiment shown in Fig.\\xa0 3f suggests the high \\nresistance of our Co-SAC to CO poisoning resulting from the weak \\ninteractions between the metal single-atomic sites and CO molecules32. \\nNo notable changes were observed in the cell voltage and FEs (>90%) when CO or other toxic gas (such as NO and SO\\n2) was injected into the \\ninput gas stream (Supplementary Fig.\\xa026). The potential for practical \\ncarbon-capture application was further demonstrated by the high \\nstability of Co-SAC in our solid-electrolyte device (Fig.\\xa03g and Sup -\\nplementary Figs.\\xa027 and 28), in which the cell voltage and FE remained \\nunchanged during the 72-h continuous carbon-capture operation \\nunder a fixed current density of 100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2.\\nTo make our study more practical, instead of using the above CO2–O2  \\nor CO2–air mixtures, we prepared simulated flue gas (13.9%\\u2009CO2, 7.8%\\u2009O2, \\n76.3%\\u2009N2 and 2.0%\\u2009H2O) as the gas input to our solid-electrolyte device. \\nA tandem reactor system, with two identical solid-electrolyte cells but \\noperated under two-stage current densities, was designed to deliver \\nboth high carbon-removal efficiencies and high FEs (Fig.\\xa0 3h).

We would like to emphasize \\nthat the PSE is an indispensable part of our carbon-capture device even \\nwith an ultrathin middle layer (Supplementary Fig.\\xa032).\\nSecond, the carbon-crossover efficiencies can be improved by means \\nof the formation of different types of anion. As discussed above, we \\nbelieve that the carbon crossover is through the carbonate ions, which \\nrequire two-electron transfer per captured CO2 molecule (0.5\\u2009CO2 per e−).  \\nOne possible alternative to improving the electron efficiency is estab -\\nlishing the CO2–H2O2 equilibrium42. Similar to the CO2–OH− reaction in \\nthe water system, CO2 can readily react with the HO2− anion from H2O2 \\nto form percarbonate (HCO4−)42. If we replace the 4e−-ORR catalyst in \\nour solid-electrolyte reactor with a 2e−-ORR catalyst7, we may obtain a \\nmaximal 50% increase in electron efficiencies. With every two-electron \\ntransfer, one OH− and one HO2− could form, which can transport 1.5\\u2009CO2 \\ngas molecules across the AEM (0.75\\u2009CO2 per e−; Fig.\\xa0 4d). To validate this \\nhypothesis, we used the Ni-SAC with a reasonable H2O2 selectivity in our \\nsolid-electrolyte reactor for carbon-capture tests (Fig.\\xa0 4e and Supple -\\nmentary Figs.\\xa033–36). As shown in Fig.\\xa0 4f, the carbon-capture rates on \\nNi-SAC suggested a notable increase compared with 4e−-ORR catalysts \\ndemonstrated above. Under 100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 current density, the 4e−-ORR \\ncatalyst presented a carbon-capture rate of around 0.7\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2, \\nwhereas the Ni-SAC delivered a rate of 1.05\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2. The increased \\ncarbon-capture rates were carefully confirmed by excluding the pos-\\nsibility of O2 gas bubbles from H2O2 self-decomposition in the PSE \\nlayer or any impacts of H2O2 on titrations (Supplementary Discus -\\nsion\\xa02 and Supplementary Figs.\\xa037 and 38). By calculating the number \\nof CO2 molecules captured per electron transferred, instead of using \\nthe above-defined FEcarbonate  resulting from the multianion crossover \\nmechanism involved, a promising 0.71\\u2009CO2 per e− was achieved under \\n100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, compared with 0.47\\u2009CO2 per e− in the case of 4e−-ORR \\n(Fig.\\xa0 4f). Using other 2e−-ORR catalysts, including oxidized carbon \\nblack (OCB) and Fe-SAC (Supplementary Figs.\\xa039 and 40), we showed \\nthat the carbon-capture electron efficiency linearly scales with H2O2 \\nselectivity under the same current density, further demonstrating the \\nimprovement of HO2− ions in transporting CO2 molecules (Fig.\\xa0 4g). We \\ncan also exclude the possibility of bicarbonate crossover in the case of \\nH2O2, which could also improve the electron efficiencies (Supplemen -\\ntary Discussion\\xa03).\\nThe improvements in cell voltages and electron efficiencies dis -\\ncussed above can further reduce the carbon-capture cost of our device.  \\nA techno-economic analysis based on previously reported models and \\nthe performance of our device (Figs.\\xa02  and 3 ) suggests a base cost of \\nabout $83 per ton of captured CO2 (refs.\\u200943 ,44) (Fig.\\xa0 4h, Supplemen -\\ntary Fig.\\xa041, Supplementary Discussion\\xa04 and Supplementary Table\\xa02).  \\nBy taking into consideration the demonstrated improvements, \\nincluding a thinner PSE layer (Fig.\\xa0 4b) and higher electron efficien -\\ncies (Fig.\\xa04f ), the estimated cost can be reduced to about $58 per ton \\nand can be more attractive if the value of generated H2O2 was included. \\nConsidering this very initial study with each component to be further \\nimproved and optimized in future research, our solid-electrolyte \\ncarbon-capture reactor represents a competitive, promising and sus-\\ntainable strategy for carbon management. For example, we can switch \\nto other facile redox couples in different application scenarios, such \\nas hydrogen evolution reaction/hydrogen oxidation reaction (HER/\\nHOR) or organic and inorganic molecular redox couples, to further \\nreduce the overpotentials. Further improvements of the ohmic drops \\nof the reactor can be expected with a thinner middle layer and more \\nconductive solid-electrolyte particles. Other operation parameters, \\nsuch as temperature for better reaction kinetics and pressure for bet-\\nter mass transport, could also be implemented for different appli -\\ncation scenarios (Supplementary Figs.\\xa042 and 43). The mentioned \\nimprovements could bring the carbon-capture cost down to about  \\n$33 per ton.Conclusion\\nGiven various electrochemical redox reactions available with proton–\\nelectron coupling processes (HER/HOR, quinone redox couples, flow \\nbattery redox couples and so on), our solid-electrolyte reactor sets \\nup a versatile carbon-capture platform that could be implemented \\nin many practical scenarios in the future. It is worth noting that many \\nelectrochemical redox couples, such as HER/HOR, present much better \\nreaction kinetics and lower overpotentials than the OER/ORR cou -\\nple we demonstrated in this work, which can substantially reduce the \\ncell-operation voltage and improve the carbon-capture efficiencies. \\nVarious cell and operation parameters, such as the thickness of the \\nsolid-electrolyte layer, operation temperature and pressure, redox cou -\\nple catalyst improvements and reaction pathway tuning, can be further \\noptimized as future research directions to improve the carbon-capture \\nenergy efficiencies and costs for practical deployments.\\nOnline content\\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summa -\\nries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowl -\\nedgements, peer review information; details of author contributions \\nand competing interests; and statements of data and code availability \\nare available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06060-1.\\n1.

Introduction\\nRecent estimates report that CO 2emissions in the world were more than 33 Gton in\\n2018 [ 1]. In order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, several international agreements\\nwere signed: the Conference of the Parties (COP21) held at Paris on the 12 December 2015\\nwas a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\\n2/1.5\\x0eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was conﬁrmed\\nby the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\\nnational determined contribution (NDC) was deﬁned [ 3]. However, in order to achieve this\\nobjective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\\nnot enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\\nFor this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\\nremoval (CDR) technologies, will have a crucial role in the coming years to achieve the\\nCO 2level deﬁned by the environmental agreements and stabilize the CO 2concentration\\nbetween 350 and 440 ppm [6,7].\\nNegative emissions technologies are deﬁned as the intentional human effort to remove\\nCO 2emissions from the atmosphere and include the following: afforestation and reforesta-\\ntion (AR), soil carbon sequestration (SCS), biochar (BC), bioenergy with carbon capture and\\nstorage (BECCS), direct air capture (DAC), enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization\\n(EW) and ocean fertilization (OF) [ 8]. Among these solutions, the research community has\\nbeen focused for the most part on DAC, due to its advantages [9].\\nDAC was used for decades to produce CO 2-free air to support life in submarines and\\nspacecraft systems [ 10,11]; it was presented by Lackner as a GHG mitigation technology\\nonly in 1999 [ 12]. DAC captures CO 2from the atmosphere to store it as part of a CDR\\nprocess in the long term (direct air carbon capture and storage—DACCS). Integrated\\nDAC systems have also been studied to supply climate-neutral CO 2for chemical processes\\nAppl.

DAC is independent of CO 2source location,\\nbecause CO 2is distributed homogeneously throughout the atmosphere, minimizing or\\neliminating CO 2transportation costs when the capture plant is situated near the utilization\\nor storage site [ 16]; the capture plant can be located in a particular place where the the re-\\nnewable energy can be exploited at the minimum cost [ 17]; DAC can tackle emissions from\\nthe transport sector and other small sources that constitute about 50% of total emissions; air\\nis ubiquitous, with few contaminants that could cause the degradation of solvents/sorbents\\n(e.g., NO x, SO xand particulates) [18]; arable land is not required, avoiding loss of agricul-\\ntural land [ 9]; the technology contributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development\\nGoals (SDGs) 13, 9, 6 (by-product water could be used as fresh water in general), 8 (creation\\nof new green jobs), 7 (exploitation of renewable energies), 11 and 12 (production of fuels\\nand materials from atmospheric CO 2) and 3 (positive effect on health) [ 17]. However, there\\nare also some disadvantages: the long term storage and sequestration of CO 2are critical\\n(costs, long-term monitoring, potentially induced seismicity and leakage) [ 19]; low CO 2\\npartial pressure in the air, about 400 ppm, 350 times lower than coal ﬂue gas so that large\\nvolumes of air should be processed to capture a signiﬁcant amount of CO 2[7,13,20]; high\\nenergy and cost requirements due to the dilute nature of CO 2in the air, requiring a large\\nvolume of air to be treated [21].\\nDAC technologies include absorption, adsorption, ion exchange resin, mineral car-\\nbonation, membrane, photocatalysis, cryogenic separation, electrochemical approach and\\nelectrodialysis approaches [ 6,18,22–26].

Thermodynamic calculation provides the minimum amount of energy for a deﬁned\\nseparation depending on the temperature, pressure and initial and ﬁnal concentrations\\nof the streams. Generally, the minimum required thermodynamic work can be evaluated\\nby the difference in stream exergies, but for isothermal and isobaric processes it can be\\nobtained by the Gibbs free energy, as shown in the following equation and Figure 1 [ 28–30]\\n(see Equation (1)):\\nWmin=RT\\x10\\nNCO2\\nBlnyCO2\\nB+NB\\x00CO2\\nBlnyB\\x00CO2\\nB\\x11\\n+RT\\x10\\nNCO2\\nClnyCO2\\nC+NC\\x00CO2\\nClnyC\\x00CO2\\nC\\x11\\n\\x00RT\\x10\\nNCO2\\nAlnyCO2\\nA+NA\\x00CO2\\nAlnyA\\x00CO2\\nA\\x11 (1)\\nwhere Wminis the minimum separation work in kJ/mol, Ris the universal gas constant\\n8.314 J/(molK), Tis the temperature in K, n iCO2are CO 2moles in stream i, n ii\\x00CO2are\\nthe other moles in current i without CO 2, yiCO2is the CO 2mole fraction in current i and\\nyii\\x00CO2is the mole fraction of the remaining gas without CO 2in stream i.\\nAppl.

DAC Technologies\\nIn this section, an overview of DAC technologies is set forth. Absorption, adsorption,\\nion exchange resin, mineral carbonation, membrane, photocatalysis, cryogenic separation,\\nelectrochemical and electrodialysis approaches are investigated.Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 8321 4 of 41\\n2.1. Absorption\\nIn absorption technology for DAC, water solutions of strong bases containing hydrox-\\nide sorbents with a strong CO 2afﬁnity, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium\\nhydroxide (KOH) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2), are used [ 3]. The absorption with\\nCa(OH) 2was proposed by Lackner et al. [ 12] and it follows the reactions described be-\\nlow [18] (see Equations (2)–(4)):\\nCa(OH)2+CO 2!CaCO 3+H2ODH25\\x0eC=\\x00109 kJ/mol (2)\\nCaCO 3!CaO +CO 2DH900\\x0eC= + 179.2 kJ/mol (3)\\nCaO +H2O!Ca(OH)2DH\\x0e\\n100\\x0eC=\\x0064.5 kJ/mol (4)\\nThe reaction starts with calcium hydroxide and CO 2to form calcium carbonate\\n(CaCO 3). The obtained calcium carbonate is precipitated, accumulated, separated from\\nwater, dried and calcined above 900\\x0eC. In this step, calcium oxide (CaO) and CO 2(con-\\ncentrated stream) are obtained. Afterwards, calcium oxide is hydrated to produce calcium\\nhydroxide. This reaction scheme allows a closed cycle. However, there are some disadvan-\\ntages to this process, such as the great amount of lost water, high temperatures and high\\nrequired energies for the calcination step (179.2 kJ/mol), and the low solubility of calcium\\nhydroxide in water, which limits the hydroxide concentration for CO 2capture [3,18].\\nThe use of NaOH water solution was proposed by Baciocchi et al. [ 37] and has a\\nsimilarity to the Kraft process used in the paper industry to extract cellulose from wood.\\nCompared to Ca(OH) 2, NaOH solution allows a strong binding of CO 2but with a higher\\nsolubility of carbonate in water. In this process, there are two cycles working simultaneously.\\nIn the ﬁrst, CO 2is captured by NaOH to produce sodium carbonate (Na 2CO 3) in the\\nabsorber through an exothermic reaction evolving at ambient temperature and pressure (see\\nEquation (5)). In the second cycle, known as the regeneration cycle, NaOH is regenerated\\nin the causticizer/precipitator: Na 2CO 3reacts with Ca(OH) 2to produce NaOH and CaCO 3\\n(see Equation (6)). From calcium carbonate, CO 2(concentrated stream) is recovered in the\\ncalciner/kiln (see Equation (7)) and receives oxygen (O 2) from an air separation unit. As\\nmentioned above, this step requires a lot of energy, with temperatures above 900\\x0eC to\\nallow the removal of water and decomposition of CaCO 3. Afterwards, CaO is hydrated to\\nCa(OH) 2in the slaker (see Equation (8)) so that it can be sent to the precipitator to be used\\nagain [18]. Figure 3 shows the scheme of this process.\\nAbsorber 2Na(OH)+CO 2!Na2CO 3+H2ODH25\\x0eC=\\x00109.4 kJ/mol (5)\\nCausticizer Na 2CO 3+Ca(OH)2!2Na(OH)+CaCO 3DH100\\x0eC=\\x005.3 kJ/mol (6)\\nCalciner CaCO 3!CaO +CO 2DH900\\x0eC= + 179.2 kJ/mol (7)\\nSlaker CaO +H2O!Ca(OH)2DH100\\x0eC=\\x0064.5 kJ/mol (8)Appl.

In fact, strong binds are present within\\nthe CaCO 3molecules [ 3]. In addition to this high energy requirement, the water loss\\n(water before calcination in the calciner must be removed) is an additional disadvantage\\nof the process.

[ 53] built an\\nabsorber prototype for the Carbon Engineering company to test the cross ﬂow and PVC\\npacking, to evaluate energy requirements and fouling by atmospheric particulates and to\\nassess technical and safety risks.\\n2.2. Adsorption\\nWhile the absorption process mainly uses an aqueous solution of NaOH, KOH or\\nCa(OH) 2, the adsorption process is based on the chemical or physical adsorption of CO 2\\nwith particular sorbents, such as amine-functionalized sorbents, metal organic frameworks\\n(MOFs), zeolites, etc. [6]. Among chemisorbents, amine-functionalized sorbents and solid\\nalkali carbonates sorbents (bulk and supported) have been proposed, while, among ph-\\nysisorbents, MOFs, zeolites and new materials, such as boron nitride nanosheets and\\nnanotubes, have been investigated [ 18]. Amine-functionalized sorbents have received sig-\\nniﬁcant attention for DAC systems due to their stability under humidity, low regeneration\\ntemperatures (50–120\\x0eC) and ﬂexibility in the choice of low-cost support [39].\\nGenerally, in the adsorption system, a single equipment unit is used, where adsorption\\nand desorption happen alternately after variations in temperature or pressure or a combi-\\nnation of the two. Generally, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is not practicable in a real\\nprocess because a pressure lower than 0.4 mbar is required. At lab scale, the temperature\\nswing adsorption (TSA) is generally used, but the use of an inert gas purge results in\\na dilute output stream. On the other hand, temperature and vacuum swing adsorption\\n(TVSA) could be used to produce a high-CO 2purity stream.\\nMost studies reported in the literature on the adsorption process are on the investigation\\nof sorbents, evaluating adsorption capacities and performances, as discussed below.\\n2.2.1. Physisorbents\\nPhysisorption occurs between the sorbent surface and CO 2, allowing only a physical\\ninteraction. Generally, materials with porosity or nanometric dimensions, such as zeolites,\\nactivated carbon, MOFs and new materials, have been considered [ 54]. Activated carbons\\nare characterized by low cost and high thermal stability, showing an adsorption capacity\\nand selectivity lower than that of zeolites at a low CO 2partial pressure but higher at a high\\nCO 2partial pressure [ 55,56]. For this reason, activated carbons are not a good choice for\\ndirect air capture [6].\\nFactors inﬂuencing the CO 2capture of zeolites are size, charge density and distribution\\nof cations in the porous structure [ 57]. Humidity has a negative effect on CO 2capture, and\\nfor this reason zeolites are not suggested for direct air capture [6].\\nMOFs are characterized by ﬂexibility in shape, pore structure, pore size and surface\\nproperties [ 58]. Similar to activated carbons, adsorption capacity and selectivity are lower\\nat low CO 2partial pressures and in the presence of humidity; MOFs are suitable for CO 2\\nstorage and not for CO 2separation. However, in recent years, attention has been directed\\nto MOFs (particularly MIL-101(Cr)) functionalized with amine (adsorption of amines onto\\nmetal sites or physical impregnation with liquid amines) which provide better performances\\nfor CO 2capture from the air due to their durability under moist conditions [ 39]. Currently,\\nthe high cost of MOFs makes their use in DAC prohibitive [6].Appl.

These materials have the ability to capture\\nCO 2from the air due to the introduction of electrons and to spontaneously desorb CO 2\\nwhen electrons are removed.\\nGenerally, adsorption with physisorbents is characterized by a low adsorption capacity\\ndue to the dilute concentration of CO 2in the air and the negative effect of moisture.

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone–hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35\\xa0nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520\\xa0mV at a current density of 10\\xa0mA\\xa0cm−2, comparable to 530\\xa0mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90\\xa0mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications. To study the interface, thin films of a PPy/[Sn(dmit)3]2 were electrochemically grown with the aid of a microcell typically used in scanning tunneling microscopy assays. Raman and FTIR spectroscopies showed the effect of dimensionality on those materials, especially on the vibrational modes of dmit ring and on the 75\\xa0nm thick PPy/[Sn (dmit)3]2 film, which presents an optimized polymer chain conjunction length and a 20\\xa0% greater contribution to the polaron charge carriers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed the polaron/bipolaron ratio data, allowing us to determine other contributions to the surface charge density. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images show the hybrid thin film's different growth modes and the roughness evolution as a function of the electrochemical signal used in the synthesis.Acetylcholinesterase modified inkjet-printed graphene/gold nanoparticle/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) hybrid electrode for ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection2023, BioelectrochemistryShow abstractThis study successfully created a portable acetylcholinesterase sensor on a printed hybrid electrode capable of detecting chlorpyrifos in the field. While a screen-printed electrode was chosen herein to enable a single-use and portable platform for the in-field application, the hybrid material was incorporated to ensure ultrasensitive detection at lower electrode potentials. The hybrid ink of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated on graphene (GP) sheets in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was synthesized through a simple completely-green one-pot process. The subsequent characterization was carried out via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The synergy resulting from the greater surface area and enhanced transfer of electrons combined with high levels of electrocatalytic activity and superb conductivity offered by GP, AuNP, and PEDOT:PSS allows the sensor to exhibit ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection at the relatively low detection limit of 0.07\\xa0nM. The sensor demonstrated in this study also exhibits good reproducibility, desirable stability, and a successful application for the real sample with satisfactory recovery results of around 106\\xa0%, indicating its potential for use as a tool in the analysis of pesticides.Enzyme based bioelectrocatalysis over laccase immobilized poly-thiophene supported carbon fiber paper for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone2022, Molecular CatalysisShow abstractA modified electrode based on laccase immobilized poly-thiophene-3-carboxylic acid supported on carbon fiber paper was developed for the electrocatalytic oxidation of D-ribofuranose to otherwise difficult-to-access D-ribonolactone, a precursor for C-nucleoside based drug like Remdesivir. The electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuranose was achieved by the TEMPO-mediated electrochemical process. The experimental parameters were optimized and validated using Design of Experiment (DoE) statistical tool indicating the concentration of TEMPO and stirring as important parameters in bulk electrolysis. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuronose followed single electron anodic oxidation of TEMPO mediated by laccase to the corresponding oxoammonium nitrosonium species which was vital for the mediated electrochemical oxidation. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation was established using cyclic voltammetry and computational studies. The plausible interactions of laccase enzyme with TEMPO mediator were studied using molecular docking experiments. This facile method was successfully applied for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone.Electropolymerized melamine for simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine2020, Food ChemistryShow abstractPoly(melamine) (PMel) was synthesized via the electropolymerization of melamine monomer, which was then characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The possible polymerization mechanisms of melamine were also revealed by FT-IR spectroscopy and UV–Vis spectroscopy. Next, the PMel modified GCE (PMel/GCE) was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite (NO2−) and tartrazine, and the parameters were optimized. The kinetic study showed that the electrochemical oxidation of nitrite and tartrazine at the surface of PMel/GCE is a typical surface-controlled electrode process. Under the optimun conditions, the developed sensor outperformed those previously reported, and it also exhibited high selectivity and reproducibility. Finally, the PMel/GCE was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine in foodstuffs, and the results indicated that the proposed sensor could be a promising candidate for accurate determination of nitrite and tartrazine in real food samples.The role of electrolytically deposited palladium and platinum metal nanoparticles dispersed onto poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene) for enhanced glucose electrooxidation in biofuel cells2020, Electrochimica ActaShow abstractGlucose biofuel cells are one of the promising power supplies with a competent long-term stability and power density. In this respect, catalysts of palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) metal nanoparticles film coated electrode were fabricated for biofuel cell. The Pt and Pd particles were electrochemically deposited onto glassy carbon (GC) electrode modified with poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene), (p-1,8-DAN), via single or layer-by-layer electrodeposition. In results, Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC and Pd-Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC shell-core catalysts were fabricated and characterized by several analytical techniques such as AFM, EDX,SEM, TEM, and XPS, in addition to electrochemical methods. Their catalytic electrooxidation behaviors of glucose were investigated in alkaline medium. The as-prepared nano-catalysts showed improved electrocatalytic performances and better stability for glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) due to the presence of metal nanoparticles. The Pd as core and Pt as shell in Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC catalyst exhibited higher electrochemically accessible surface area (157.58 m2/g) and a favored electrooxidation efficiency. Moreover, the bimetallic Pt-Pd shell-core electrode showed higher resistance to poisoning (tolerance 1.24) and a decrease in the onset potential to -0.28\\xa0V. These multipurpose electro-catalysts are a potential candidate for developing a novel glucose biofuel cell.View all citing articles on ScopusResearch articleRecent advances in the synthesis of conducting polymers from the vapour phaseProgress in Materials Science, Volume 86, 2017, pp. 127-146Show abstractInherently conducting polymers (ICPs) combine the electrical properties of metals and semiconductors with a polymer’s ability to flex and/or stretch. In general, polymers are relatively simple to synthesise, however, ICPs themselves have had limited uptake in consumer devices. This lack of uptake is in part related to the insolubility of many ICPs in common industrial solvents, and hence methods to manufacture them in a usable form have been problematic. Vapour phase polymerisation (VPP) is one method that provides a convenient route to producing thin films of both soluble and insoluble ICPs, and nanocomposites thereof. In this critical review the VPP process will be discussed from the fundamental viewpoint of the proposed polymerisation mechanism and the parameters affecting polymer growth for a range of different monomers (thiophene, 3-hexylthiophene, pyrrole, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, etc.). Looking forward into the future, new areas of polymer design and fabrication using VPP will be discussed, such as the enhancement of ICPs through additives, and next generation device fabrication based upon VPP ICPs.Research articleConducting polymeric nanocomposites: A review in solar fuel applicationsFuel, Volume 325, 2022, Article 124899Show abstractOver the last few decades, research is being carried out in the field of photocatalysis to investigate for fuels production in sustainable manner. Due to an energy depletion and CO2 emission in the current situation urge us to produce alternative fuels. Water splitting and the reduction of carbon dioxide using various photocatalysts are being developed as promising sustainable methods to obtain eco-friendly energy sources. Conducting polymers (CP) stand out among the current pool of studied photocatalysts due to their high light absorption efficiency, good stability, tunable electronic characteristics, and cost effectiveness. Various CP, such as polyaniline, polythiophene, and polypyrrole have been integrated with different semiconducting nanomaterials to produce photocatalytic composites. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the synthesis of CP and their nanocomposites for application in CO2 photoreduction and water splitting into fuel production using different polymeric composites. Many composite photocatalysts show synergistic effects between the polymeric material and other counterparts in the composite. The improvement in the inactivity of the composite can be attributed to the band configurations of the composite. Improving the separation of excitons, widening the light absorption region, enhancing the substrate adsorption, and preventing photocorrosion conductive polymers can significantly increase the photocatalytic activity under visible light. The addition of conducting polymers with an inorganic materials dramatically change their band positions and may reduce the possiblilty of electron hole recombination. Here, we explain by what means conductive polymeric material can improve the efficiency of the composite in an organized manner, thereby providing a comprehensive reference to the field. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of polymeric catalysts have been discussed briefly.Research articlePolyaniline/polyvinyl alcohol blends: Effect of sulfonic acid dopants on microstructural, optical, thermal and electrical propertiesSynthetic Metals, Volume 191, 2014, pp. 126-134Show abstractThis correspondence reports the preparation and performance of different polyaniline–polyvinyl blends (PANI–PVA) doped with sulfonated acids. PANI is prepared by in situ dispersion polymerisation, and a subsequent extensive study determines the effect of protonation upon doping with four different types of acids. We obtain the blends by changing the four different dopants, viz. β-naphtalenesulfonic acid (NSA), camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) and p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA), while maintaining constant PANI and PVA concentrations. The polymer thin films are deposited on glass substrates by the dip-cast procedure. Lastly, the films of the obtained blends are characterised by surface, structural morphology (elemental analysis, AFM, SEM, FTIR and XRD), thermal properties (TGA and DSC) and UV–vis spectroscopy. The morphological analysis shows that the nanoparticles form different shapes, which depend on the type of dopant, whereas the FTIR spectra show the chemical interaction between the two polymers. The thermal study reveals three-step degradation of the polymer blends. To confirm the possible use of these blends in the electrical industry, the electrical properties are studied by in-plane I–V characteristics and four probe conductivity measurements.Research articleIntrinsically conducting polymers in electrochemical energy technology: Trends and progressElectrochimica Acta, Volume 122, 2014, pp. 93-107Show abstractThe use of intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) like polythiophene (PTh), polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) in devices and systems for electrochemical energy storage and conversion is briefly reviewed with a focus on an overview distinguishing between already established uses and potential applications. Basic principles in these three major fields are highlighted:•ICPs as active masses.•ICPs as conductance-enhancing additives.•ICPs as auxiliary materials beyond conductance.Research articleMultifunctional electrocatalysts derived from conducting polymer and metal organic framework complexesNano Energy, Volume 45, 2018, pp. 127-135Show abstractHigh cost, scarcity, and detrimental environmental effect of the noble-metal based catalysts have prompted the seek of less expensive, more benign, and earth abundant substitutes for energy conversion and storage. Here, we demonstrate a novel multifunctional electrocatalyst constructed by pyrolysis of the complex of polyaniline (PANI) and metal organic framework [Co-based MOF; zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67)]. The resultant PANI/ZIF-67 complex unveiled excellent electrocatalytic activities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. It was found that the catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 complex towards ORR, OER and HER could be tuned by simple changing the weight ratio of PANI to the MOF. Further, we tested the material as an air electrode for a primary zinc-air battery, demonstrating an open-circuit potential of 1.42\\xa0V and a peak power density of ~ 45\\xa0mW\\xa0cm−2 - both are superior to those of its counterpart of the Pt/C air-electrode. The excellent multifunctional catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 are mainly attributed to the synergistic combination of cobalt nanoparticles, Co3O4, and nitrogen doped carbon from the PANI/ZIF-67 complex after pyrolysis.Research articleProtective polymeric films for industrial substrates: A critical review on past and recent applications with conducting polymers and polymer composites/nanocompositesProgress in Materials Science, Volume 104, 2019, pp. 380-450Show abstractCorrosion defined as the deterioration of a material when it interacts with its environment is a global problem. Among the different strategies employed to combat corrosion, the use of coatings and corrosion inhibitors are the most popular. Coatings or corrosion inhibitors form a layer over the metallic substrate and protect it against corrosion. Polymers, both naturally occurring and synthetic have been tested for metal corrosion protection as replacement for the toxic inorganic and organic corrosion inhibitors. Interest in them stems from their availability, cost effectiveness, and eco-friendliness (especially for natural polymers) in addition to the inherent stability and multiple adsorption centers. However, it is found that most polymeric materials studied are moderate corrosion inhibitors. Several attempts such as copolymerization, addition of substances that exert synergistic effect, cross linking, blending, and most recently incorporation of inorganic substances in nano size into the polymer matrix have been made to improve the inhibition ability of polymers. In this review, the application of conducting polymers, polymer composites and nanocomposites for corrosion protection of different industrial metal substrates are explored based on reported experimental data and their mechanism of inhibition explained. Some identified drawbacks and future direction in this area have also been highlighted.View full textCopyright © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\n",

    "    We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30 percent loss of capacity after 7000 cycles.\n",

      "Recent estimates report that CO 2emissions in the world were more than 33 Gton in\n",
      "2018 [ 1]. In order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, several international agreements\n",
      "were signed: the Conference of the Parties (COP21) held at Paris on the 12 December 2015\n",
      "was a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\n",
      "2/1.5\u000eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was conﬁrmed\n",
      "by the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\n",
      "national determined contribution (NDC) was deﬁned [ 3]. However, in order to achieve this\n",
      "objective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\n",
      "not enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\n",
      "For this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\n",
      "removal (CDR) technologies, will have a crucial role in the coming years to achieve the\n",
      "CO 2level deﬁned by the environmental agreements and stabilize the CO 2concentration\n",
      "between 350 and 440 ppm [6,7].\n",

      "been focused for the most part on DAC, due to its advantages [9].\n",
      "DAC was used for decades to produce CO 2-free air to support life in submarines and\n",
      "spacecraft systems [ 10,11]; it was presented by Lackner as a GHG mitigation technology\n",

      "were signed: the Conference of the Parties (COP21) held at Paris on the 12 December 2015\n",
      "was a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\n",
      "2/1.5\u000eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was conﬁrmed\n",
      "by the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\n",
      "national determined contribution (NDC) was deﬁned [ 3]. However, in order to achieve this\n",
      "objective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\n",
      "not enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\n",
      "For this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\n",

      "The tangential research paper presents a continuous electrochemical carbon capture system that couples oxygen/water redox reactions with a solid-electrolyte reactor. The system efficiently absorbs dilute CO2 molecules at the cathode-membrane interface, forms carbonate ions, and continuously outputs a high-purity CO2 stream. The main findings of the paper demonstrate high carbon-capture rates, high Faradaic efficiencies, high carbon-removal efficiency, and low energy consumption. The system does not require chemical inputs or generate side products during the carbon absorption/release process.\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings are significant because they provide a promising approach to carbon capture that addresses the limitations of other methods, such as low capture rates, oxygen sensitivity, and energy-intensive processes. The continuous electrochemical carbon capture system demonstrated in the paper offers high efficiency, decentralized operation, and the ability to use renewable electricity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main drawback demonstrated in the tangential research paper is the sensitivity of the system to oxygen in the feed stream. The presence of oxygen can reduce the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system and requires careful tuning of the electron density of the quinone polymer to avoid reactions with oxygen. This sensitivity to oxygen limits the system's effectiveness in capturing CO2 in the presence of oxygen.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve the ultimate goal of proposing a carbon capture system more efficient than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured, the tangential research paper's main findings can be useful. The continuous electrochemical carbon capture system demonstrated in the paper offers high carbon-capture rates, high Faradaic efficiencies, and low energy consumption. These findings can be used as a starting point for developing a more efficient carbon capture system by further optimizing the system's design, materials, and operating conditions. Additionally, the use of different redox couples and catalysts, as mentioned in the paper, can be explored to improve the system's efficiency and address the sensitivity to oxygen.\n",

      " The tangential research paper presents a continuous electrochemical carbon capture system that couples oxygen/water redox reactions with a solid-electrolyte reactor. The system efficiently absorbs dilute CO2 molecules at the cathode-membrane interface, forms carbonate ions, and continuously outputs a high-purity CO2 stream. The main findings of the paper demonstrate high carbon-capture rates, high Faradaic efficiencies, high carbon-removal efficiency, and low energy consumption. The system does not require chemical inputs or generate side products during the carbon absorption/release process.\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings are significant because they provide a promising approach to carbon capture that addresses the limitations of other methods, such as low capture rates, oxygen sensitivity, and energy-intensive processes.

      "\n",
      "The main drawback demonstrated in the tangential research paper is the sensitivity of the system to oxygen in the feed stream. The presence of oxygen can reduce the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system and requires careful tuning of the electron density of the quinone polymer to avoid reactions with oxygen. This sensitivity to oxygen limits the system's effectiveness in capturing CO2 in the presence of oxygen.\n",

These findings can be used as a starting point for developing a more efficient carbon capture system by further optimizing the system's design, materials, and operating conditions.

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone–hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35 nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, comparable to 530 mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90 mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications. To study the interface, thin films of a PPy/[Sn(dmit)3]2 were electrochemically grown with the aid of a microcell typically used in scanning tunneling microscopy assays. Raman and FTIR spectroscopies showed the effect of dimensionality on those materials, especially on the vibrational modes of dmit ring and on the 75 nm thick PPy/[Sn (dmit)3]2 film, which presents an optimized polymer chain conjunction length and a 20 % greater contribution to the polaron charge carriers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed the polaron/bipolaron ratio data, allowing us to determine other contributions to the surface charge density. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images show the hybrid thin film's different growth modes and the roughness evolution as a function of the electrochemical signal used in the synthesis.Acetylcholinesterase modified inkjet-printed graphene/gold nanoparticle/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) hybrid electrode for ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection2023, BioelectrochemistryShow abstractThis study successfully created a portable acetylcholinesterase sensor on a printed hybrid electrode capable of detecting chlorpyrifos in the field. While a screen-printed electrode was chosen herein to enable a single-use and portable platform for the in-field application, the hybrid material was incorporated to ensure ultrasensitive detection at lower electrode potentials. The hybrid ink of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated on graphene (GP) sheets in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was synthesized through a simple completely-green one-pot process. The subsequent characterization was carried out via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The synergy resulting from the greater surface area and enhanced transfer of electrons combined with high levels of electrocatalytic activity and superb conductivity offered by GP, AuNP, and PEDOT:PSS allows the sensor to exhibit ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection at the relatively low detection limit of 0.07 nM. The sensor demonstrated in this study also exhibits good reproducibility, desirable stability, and a successful application for the real sample with satisfactory recovery results of around 106 %, indicating its potential for use as a tool in the analysis of pesticides.Enzyme based bioelectrocatalysis over laccase immobilized poly-thiophene supported carbon fiber paper for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone2022, Molecular CatalysisShow abstractA modified electrode based on laccase immobilized poly-thiophene-3-carboxylic acid supported on carbon fiber paper was developed for the electrocatalytic oxidation of D-ribofuranose to otherwise difficult-to-access D-ribonolactone, a precursor for C-nucleoside based drug like Remdesivir. The electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuranose was achieved by the TEMPO-mediated electrochemical process. The experimental parameters were optimized and validated using Design of Experiment (DoE) statistical tool indicating the concentration of TEMPO and stirring as important parameters in bulk electrolysis. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuronose followed single electron anodic oxidation of TEMPO mediated by laccase to the corresponding oxoammonium nitrosonium species which was vital for the mediated electrochemical oxidation. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation was established using cyclic voltammetry and computational studies. The plausible interactions of laccase enzyme with TEMPO mediator were studied using molecular docking experiments. This facile method was successfully applied for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone.Electropolymerized melamine for simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine2020, Food ChemistryShow abstractPoly(melamine) (PMel) was synthesized via the electropolymerization of melamine monomer, which was then characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The possible polymerization mechanisms of melamine were also revealed by FT-IR spectroscopy and UV–Vis spectroscopy. Next, the PMel modified GCE (PMel/GCE) was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite (NO2−) and tartrazine, and the parameters were optimized. The kinetic study showed that the electrochemical oxidation of nitrite and tartrazine at the surface of PMel/GCE is a typical surface-controlled electrode process. Under the optimun conditions, the developed sensor outperformed those previously reported, and it also exhibited high selectivity and reproducibility. Finally, the PMel/GCE was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine in foodstuffs, and the results indicated that the proposed sensor could be a promising candidate for accurate determination of nitrite and tartrazine in real food samples.The role of electrolytically deposited palladium and platinum metal nanoparticles dispersed onto poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene) for enhanced glucose electrooxidation in biofuel cells2020, Electrochimica ActaShow abstractGlucose biofuel cells are one of the promising power supplies with a competent long-term stability and power density. In this respect, catalysts of palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) metal nanoparticles film coated electrode were fabricated for biofuel cell. The Pt and Pd particles were electrochemically deposited onto glassy carbon (GC) electrode modified with poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene), (p-1,8-DAN), via single or layer-by-layer electrodeposition. In results, Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC and Pd-Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC shell-core catalysts were fabricated and characterized by several analytical techniques such as AFM, EDX,SEM, TEM, and XPS, in addition to electrochemical methods. Their catalytic electrooxidation behaviors of glucose were investigated in alkaline medium. The as-prepared nano-catalysts showed improved electrocatalytic performances and better stability for glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) due to the presence of metal nanoparticles. The Pd as core and Pt as shell in Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC catalyst exhibited higher electrochemically accessible surface area (157.58 m2/g) and a favored electrooxidation efficiency. Moreover, the bimetallic Pt-Pd shell-core electrode showed higher resistance to poisoning (tolerance 1.24) and a decrease in the onset potential to -0.28 V. These multipurpose electro-catalysts are a potential candidate for developing a novel glucose biofuel cell.View all citing articles on ScopusResearch articleRecent advances in the synthesis of conducting polymers from the vapour phaseProgress in Materials Science, Volume 86, 2017, pp. 127-146Show abstractInherently conducting polymers (ICPs) combine the electrical properties of metals and semiconductors with a polymer’s ability to flex and/or stretch. In general, polymers are relatively simple to synthesise, however, ICPs themselves have had limited uptake in consumer devices. This lack of uptake is in part related to the insolubility of many ICPs in common industrial solvents, and hence methods to manufacture them in a usable form have been problematic. Vapour phase polymerisation (VPP) is one method that provides a convenient route to producing thin films of both soluble and insoluble ICPs, and nanocomposites thereof. In this critical review the VPP process will be discussed from the fundamental viewpoint of the proposed polymerisation mechanism and the parameters affecting polymer growth for a range of different monomers (thiophene, 3-hexylthiophene, pyrrole, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, etc.). Looking forward into the future, new areas of polymer design and fabrication using VPP will be discussed, such as the enhancement of ICPs through additives, and next generation device fabrication based upon VPP ICPs.Research articleConducting polymeric nanocomposites: A review in solar fuel applicationsFuel, Volume 325, 2022, Article 124899Show abstractOver the last few decades, research is being carried out in the field of photocatalysis to investigate for fuels production in sustainable manner. Due to an energy depletion and CO2 emission in the current situation urge us to produce alternative fuels. Water splitting and the reduction of carbon dioxide using various photocatalysts are being developed as promising sustainable methods to obtain eco-friendly energy sources. Conducting polymers (CP) stand out among the current pool of studied photocatalysts due to their high light absorption efficiency, good stability, tunable electronic characteristics, and cost effectiveness. Various CP, such as polyaniline, polythiophene, and polypyrrole have been integrated with different semiconducting nanomaterials to produce photocatalytic composites. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the synthesis of CP and their nanocomposites for application in CO2 photoreduction and water splitting into fuel production using different polymeric composites. Many composite photocatalysts show synergistic effects between the polymeric material and other counterparts in the composite. The improvement in the inactivity of the composite can be attributed to the band configurations of the composite. Improving the separation of excitons, widening the light absorption region, enhancing the substrate adsorption, and preventing photocorrosion conductive polymers can significantly increase the photocatalytic activity under visible light. The addition of conducting polymers with an inorganic materials dramatically change their band positions and may reduce the possiblilty of electron hole recombination. Here, we explain by what means conductive polymeric material can improve the efficiency of the composite in an organized manner, thereby providing a comprehensive reference to the field. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of polymeric catalysts have been discussed briefly.Research articlePolyaniline/polyvinyl alcohol blends: Effect of sulfonic acid dopants on microstructural, optical, thermal and electrical propertiesSynthetic Metals, Volume 191, 2014, pp. 126-134Show abstractThis correspondence reports the preparation and performance of different polyaniline–polyvinyl blends (PANI–PVA) doped with sulfonated acids. PANI is prepared by in situ dispersion polymerisation, and a subsequent extensive study determines the effect of protonation upon doping with four different types of acids. We obtain the blends by changing the four different dopants, viz. β-naphtalenesulfonic acid (NSA), camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) and p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA), while maintaining constant PANI and PVA concentrations. The polymer thin films are deposited on glass substrates by the dip-cast procedure. Lastly, the films of the obtained blends are characterised by surface, structural morphology (elemental analysis, AFM, SEM, FTIR and XRD), thermal properties (TGA and DSC) and UV–vis spectroscopy. The morphological analysis shows that the nanoparticles form different shapes, which depend on the type of dopant, whereas the FTIR spectra show the chemical interaction between the two polymers. The thermal study reveals three-step degradation of the polymer blends. To confirm the possible use of these blends in the electrical industry, the electrical properties are studied by in-plane I–V characteristics and four probe conductivity measurements.Research articleIntrinsically conducting polymers in electrochemical energy technology: Trends and progressElectrochimica Acta, Volume 122, 2014, pp. 93-107Show abstractThe use of intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) like polythiophene (PTh), polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) in devices and systems for electrochemical energy storage and conversion is briefly reviewed with a focus on an overview distinguishing between already established uses and potential applications.

Here, we demonstrate a novel multifunctional electrocatalyst constructed by pyrolysis of the complex of polyaniline (PANI) and metal organic framework [Co-based MOF; zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67)]. The resultant PANI/ZIF-67 complex unveiled excellent electrocatalytic activities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. It was found that the catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 complex towards ORR, OER and HER could be tuned by simple changing the weight ratio of PANI to the MOF. Further, we tested the material as an air electrode for a primary zinc-air battery, demonstrating an open-circuit potential of 1.42 V and a peak power density of ~ 45 mW cm−2 - both are superior to those of its counterpart of the Pt/C air-electrode. The excellent multifunctional catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 are mainly attributed to the synergistic combination of cobalt nanoparticles, Co3O4, and nitrogen doped carbon from the PANI/ZIF-67 complex after pyrolysis.Research articleProtective polymeric films for industrial substrates: A critical review on past and recent applications with conducting polymers and polymer composites/nanocompositesProgress in Materials Science, Volume 104, 2019, pp. 380-450Show abstractCorrosion defined as the deterioration of a material when it interacts with its environment is a global problem. Among the different strategies employed to combat corrosion, the use of coatings and corrosion inhibitors are the most popular. Coatings or corrosion inhibitors form a layer over the metallic substrate and protect it against corrosion. Polymers, both naturally occurring and synthetic have been tested for metal corrosion protection as replacement for the toxic inorganic and organic corrosion inhibitors. Interest in them stems from their availability, cost effectiveness, and eco-friendliness (especially for natural polymers) in addition to the inherent stability and multiple adsorption centers. However, it is found that most polymeric materials studied are moderate corrosion inhibitors. Several attempts such as copolymerization, addition of substances that exert synergistic effect, cross linking, blending, and most recently incorporation of inorganic substances in nano size into the polymer matrix have been made to improve the inhibition ability of polymers. In this review, the application of conducting polymers, polymer composites and nanocomposites for corrosion protection of different industrial metal substrates are explored based on reported experimental data and their mechanism of inhibition explained. Some identified drawbacks and future direction in this area have also been highlighted.View full textCopyright © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.\n",

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone–hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35 nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, comparable to 530 mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90 mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications. To study the interface, thin films of a PPy/[Sn(dmit)3]2 were electrochemically grown with the aid of a microcell typically used in scanning tunneling microscopy assays. Raman and FTIR spectroscopies showed the effect of dimensionality on those materials, especially on the vibrational modes of dmit ring and on the 75 nm thick PPy/[Sn (dmit)3]2 film, which presents an optimized polymer chain conjunction length and a 20 % greater contribution to the polaron charge carriers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed the polaron/bipolaron ratio data, allowing us to determine other contributions to the surface charge density. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images show the hybrid thin film's different growth modes and the roughness evolution as a function of the electrochemical signal used in the synthesis.Acetylcholinesterase modified inkjet-printed graphene/gold nanoparticle/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) hybrid electrode for ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection2023, BioelectrochemistryShow abstractThis study successfully created a portable acetylcholinesterase sensor on a printed hybrid electrode capable of detecting chlorpyrifos in the field. While a screen-printed electrode was chosen herein to enable a single-use and portable platform for the in-field application, the hybrid material was incorporated to ensure ultrasensitive detection at lower electrode potentials. The hybrid ink of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated on graphene (GP) sheets in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was synthesized through a simple completely-green one-pot process. The subsequent characterization was carried out via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The synergy resulting from the greater surface area and enhanced transfer of electrons combined with high levels of electrocatalytic activity and superb conductivity offered by GP, AuNP, and PEDOT:PSS allows the sensor to exhibit ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection at the relatively low detection limit of 0.07 nM. The sensor demonstrated in this study also exhibits good reproducibility, desirable stability, and a successful application for the real sample with satisfactory recovery results of around 106 %, indicating its potential for use as a tool in the analysis of pesticides.Enzyme based bioelectrocatalysis over laccase immobilized poly-thiophene supported carbon fiber paper for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone2022, Molecular CatalysisShow abstractA modified electrode based on laccase immobilized poly-thiophene-3-carboxylic acid supported on carbon fiber paper was developed for the electrocatalytic oxidation of D-ribofuranose to otherwise difficult-to-access D-ribonolactone, a precursor for C-nucleoside based drug like Remdesivir. The electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuranose was achieved by the TEMPO-mediated electrochemical process. The experimental parameters were optimized and validated using Design of Experiment (DoE) statistical tool indicating the concentration of TEMPO and stirring as important parameters in bulk electrolysis. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuronose followed single electron anodic oxidation of TEMPO mediated by laccase to the corresponding oxoammonium nitrosonium species which was vital for the mediated electrochemical oxidation. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation was established using cyclic voltammetry and computational studies. The plausible interactions of laccase enzyme with TEMPO mediator were studied using molecular docking experiments. This facile method was successfully applied for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone.Electropolymerized melamine for simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine2020, Food ChemistryShow abstractPoly(melamine) (PMel) was synthesized via the electropolymerization of melamine monomer, which was then characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

Further, we tested the material as an air electrode for a primary zinc-air battery, demonstrating an open-circuit potential of 1.42 V and a peak power density of ~ 45 mW cm−2 - both are superior to those of its counterpart of the Pt/C air-electrode. The excellent multifunctional catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 are mainly attributed to the synergistic combination of cobalt nanoparticles, Co3O4, and nitrogen doped carbon from the PANI/ZIF-67 complex after pyrolysis.Research articleProtective polymeric films for industrial substrates: A critical review on past and recent applications with conducting polymers and polymer composites/nanocompositesProgress in Materials Science, Volume 104, 2019, pp. 380-450Show abstractCorrosion defined as the deterioration of a material when it interacts with its environment is a global problem. Among the different strategies employed to combat corrosion, the use of coatings and corrosion inhibitors are the most popular. Coatings or corrosion inhibitors form a layer over the metallic substrate and protect it against corrosion. Polymers, both naturally occurring and synthetic have been tested for metal corrosion protection as replacement for the toxic inorganic and organic corrosion inhibitors. Interest in them stems from their availability, cost effectiveness, and eco-friendliness (especially for natural polymers) in addition to the inherent stability and multiple adsorption centers. However, it is found that most polymeric materials studied are moderate corrosion inhibitors. Several attempts such as copolymerization, addition of substances that exert synergistic effect, cross linking, blending, and most recently incorporation of inorganic substances in nano size into the polymer matrix have been made to improve the inhibition ability of polymers. In this review, the application of conducting polymers, polymer composites and nanocomposites for corrosion protection of different industrial metal substrates are explored based on reported experimental data and their mechanism of inhibition explained. Some identified drawbacks and future direction in this area have also been highlighted.View full textCopyright © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved. \n",

      "AbstractCarbon capture is essential for mitigating carbon dioxide emissions. Compared to conventional chemical scrubbing, electrochemically mediated carbon capture utilizing redox-active sorbents such as quinones is emerging as a more versatile and economical alternative. However, the practicality of such systems is hindered by the requirement of toxic, flammable organic electrolytes or often costly ionic liquids. Herein, we demonstrate that rationally designed aqueous electrolytes with high salt concentration can effectively resolve the incompatibility between aqueous environments and quinone electrochemistry for carbon capture, eliminating the safety, toxicity, and at least partially the cost concerns in previous studies. Salt-concentrated aqueous media also offer distinct advantages including extended electrochemical window, high carbon dioxide activity, significantly reduced evaporative loss and material dissolution, and importantly, greatly suppressed competing reactions including under simulated flue gas. Correspondingly, we achieve continuous carbon capture-release operations with outstanding capacity, stability, efficiency and electrokinetics, advancing electrochemical carbon separation further towards practical applications.\n",
      "IntroductionAnthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions present a serious challenge to our society. One of the foremost mitigation strategies involves carbon capture, particularly from large stationary emission sources, followed by sequestration or utilization1,2,3,4,5. The incumbent technology for carbon capture is wet chemical scrubbing, which utilizes aqueous amines to chemically absorb CO2 and subsequently release it by desorption via a temperature-swing process. However, this process is challenged by the substantial energy demand associated with the regeneration step, sorbent degradation, corrosion, environmental concerns and large footprint3,6. To this end, emerging materials such as water-lean solvents and porous solid sorbents have also been garnering widespread attention, with many showing promising capture properties7,8,9,10. Nevertheless, most of these CO2 storing materials are still reliant on high pressure and/or temperature-swing conditions during their operation cycles10. Electrochemically mediated separations offer a low-temperature, ambient-pressure alternative for carbon capture, representing a promising yet largely unchartered research area11,12,13,14,15,16. By being electrically driven, these systems can be controlled precisely to reduce energy losses, are modular and thus easy to implement in a variety of locations, and possess great adaptability to the multiscale nature of carbon capture.In one form of electrochemically mediated carbon capture, redox-active organic compounds serve as CO2 carriers. Electrochemical reduction of these compounds generates nucleophiles with a high binding affinity towards electrophilic CO2 to afford stable sorbent-CO2 adducts; subsequently, the adducts can be oxidized to liberate pure CO2 while regenerating the sorbents13. To date, several classes of redox-active compounds have been explored, with quinoid species being the most representative example16,17,18,19,20. Quinones are a class of cyclic compounds containing two carbonyl groups in an unsaturated six-membered ring structure, which have been studied extensively for their key roles in biological electron transport as well as for promising applications in catalysis and energy storage21. They are versatile molecules with highly tailorable electrochemical properties through molecular engineering and can be synthesized from inexpensive commodity chemicals, which is favorable for large-scale applications22. Moreover, quinones as CO2 sorbents can have an appealingly high theoretical capacity of two CO2 equivalents per molecule, compared to conventional wet scrubbing which requires two equivalents of amine to capture one equivalent of CO2. Mizen and Wrighton23 first reported that electrogenerated 9,10-phenanthrenequinone dianion can chemically react with CO2 in homogeneous solutions to yield bis(carbonate), and further studies expanded the quinone chemistries for reversible CO2 capture-release16,17,18,24,25. Despite this progress, electrochemically mediated CO2 separations still need to be operated using mainly flammable, toxic aprotic organic electrolytes, posing a great barrier toward practical implementation13. Recently, the relatively benign ionic liquids have also been explored as electrolytes for electrochemically mediated CO2 separations16,18. While it may not be a major issue for batch-based separation processes with lean electrolytes, the often-expensive ionic liquids can raise serious cost concerns in continuous-flow absorption systems where they are needed in excess for the dissolution of redox-active CO2 carriers.An aqueous electrolyte is the ideal medium for large-scale electrochemical systems, offering distinct advantages in cost, safety, environmental benignity, and ease of device construction. Carbon capture via redox-active sorbents in aqueous electrolytes is, however, confronted with serious challenges. One critical limitation originates from the narrow electrochemical stability window of water, which is insufficient to support the reductive addition of CO2 to quinone molecules without incurring parasitic reactions (hydrogen evolution)23,26. Compared to aprotic solvents, aqueous media are complicated by the speciation of CO2 upon dissolution, which can undermine the activity of dissolved molecular CO2 given inappropriate solution pH15. Importantly, various competing reactions with reduced quinone molecules are expected in aqueous solutions, particularly protonation and ion association, hindering severely the kinetics and efficiency of carbon capture13,27,28,29. Finally, rapid evaporative loss is a long-standing concern when interfacing aqueous electrolytes with continuous gas flow, which can seriously compromise the service life of the electrochemical systems30.Herein, by drawing inspiration from the recent breakthrough in salt-concentrated electrolytes for battery applications, we develop an aqueous electrolyte formulation that is fully compatible with quinone-mediated electrochemical carbon capture26,30,31,32. Salt-concentrated aqueous electrolytes, also known as “water-in-salt” electrolytes, are defined as those in which dissolved salt outnumbers water by both mass and volume26. In these solutions, the number of water molecules is insufficient to fully solvate the cations so that no free-state water exists, which can effectively suppress the activity of water molecules to extend the electrochemical stability window. By selecting appropriate salt species, desirable solution pH can be realized so that the total dissolved inorganic carbon is composed primarily of molecular CO2. It is worthwhile highlighting that, compared to their dilute counterpart, reduced quinone dianions are thermodynamically more reactive towards CO2 and less prone to competing reactions in salt-concentrated electrolytes, due to the modified dielectric environment. This results in enhanced carbon capture kinetics and capacity, as verified by both experiments and theoretical calculations. Additional technical superiorities, including high water retention under continuous gas sparging, and diminished dissolution of electrode-immobilized quinone molecules compared to organic electrolytes, are also observed when using our salt-concentrated electrolyte system. These multifold advantages enable the demonstration of quinone-meditated CO2 capture-release with excellent capacity, kinetics, reversibility and stability in aqueous media, advancing electrochemical carbon separation further towards practical applications.ResultsElectrochemistry of quinone-mediated CO2 captureFigure 1a shows the overall reaction of quinone-mediated CO2 capture and release, using anthraquinone (AQ) as an example. In aprotic media absent of electrophiles, quinones typically undergo two successive one-electron reductions (Fig. 1b, N2, and further illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1), corresponding to the reversible formation of semiquinone radical anion (AQ•–) and quinone dianion (AQ2–). Interestingly, only a single reduction wave can be observed in the presence of electrophilic CO2 and the current nearly doubles with respect to that under N2 at the first reduction potential (Fig. 1b, CO2), indicating the interaction between reduced quinones and CO2. The complexation of CO2 with quinone is believed to proceed via an ECEC mechanism (E, electron transfer; C, chemical reaction)33. Namely, the reduction of AQ affords AQ•–, which can react chemically with CO2 through nucleophilic addition; the resulting carbonate renders the quinone aromatic ring relatively neutral such that the second electron transfer can occur at nearly the same potential, generating one additional nucleophilic oxygen for CO2 attachment (Supplementary Fig. 2).Fig. 1: Electrochemistry of quinone-mediated CO2 capture.a The overall reductive addition reaction between CO2 and AQ. b CV of AQ in an aprotic organic solvent with and without CO2. The CV scans were carried out in 5 mM AQ in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) supporting salt. Glassy carbon was used as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, Ag wire as a pseudo-reference electrode, and 1 mM ferrocene (Fc) as an internal reference. The scan rate was 50 mV s−1. c Major competing reactions when carrying out quinone-mediated CO2 capture in aqueous media.Full size imageSimilar electrochemical behavior is also commonly observed in protic electrolytes, where reduced quinones can react with protons to form hydroxyl groups via a two-electron reduction process22. Correspondingly, one immediate hurdle when attempting to carry out quinone-mediated carbon capture in aqueous solutions is the rapid protonation of the reduced quinone molecules (Fig. 1c). For example, the rate constant for AQ2− protonation was determined to be twice that of the reaction with CO2, such that full utilization of the carbon capture capacity is hardly achievable in the presence of proton donors27. Moreover, since both the tendency for quinone protonation and the activity of dissolved molecular CO2 increase with increasing solution acidity, an obvious dilemma is presented for aqueous electrolyte formulation. In addition to protonation through the formation of covalent bonds, cations in the supporting electrolyte can also stabilize quinone anions via Coulombic ion pairing (Fig. 1c), which may further reduce the driving force for CO2 complexation29.Aqueous electrolyte for quinone-mediated CO2 captureThe prerequisite for quinone-mediated CO2 capture-release in aqueous media is a wide electrochemical stability window of the electrolytes. Since only reduced quinones with sufficient electron density can undergo nucleophilic addition with molecular CO2, the formation of quinone-CO2 adducts generally occurs at potentials more negative than the reductive decomposition (hydrogen evolution reaction) potential of water33. Figure 2a compares the cyclic voltammogram (CV) of AQ under CO2 with the stability window of 1m LiTFSI aqueous solution (where m is molality and LiTFSI represents lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide). The reduction peak of AQ occurred at ~0.88 V vs. Ag/AgCl, whereas the electrolyte started to decompose as early as –0.81 V vs. Ag/AgCl (defined as the potential where the current density reaches 0.01 mA cm–2).Fig. 2: Rational electrolyte formulation for quinone-mediated CO2 capture in aqueous media.a Linear sweep voltammetry of 1 and 20m LiTFSI aqueous electrolytes at a rate of 1 mV s−1, compared with the CV of AQ under CO2.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageSalt-concentrated electrolytes, recently gaining momentum in battery research, are proposed to offer an extended electrochemical stability window by eliminating the presence of free-state water through cation solvation26,30,31,32. For example, when the concentration of LiTFSI was increased to an ultrahigh level of 20m, the cathodic decomposition potential of the electrolyte was shifted to –1.11 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is sufficient to envelop the electrochemical capture and release of CO2 by quinones.To ensure high solubility, salt species with stable and charge-delocalized anions, such as acetate, TFSI, trifluoromethanesulfonate, and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, are preferred when formulating water-in-salt electrolytes31. Nevertheless, not all of these salts are compatible with electrochemically mediated carbon capture. Gaseous CO2 has many possible transformations upon dissolution in water, yet only dissolved molecular CO2(aq) is active towards complexation with reduced quinones (Fig. 2b). Therefore, electrolytes for electrochemically mediated carbon capture should have a pH value of less than 6 to ensure the dominance of CO2(aq)15. The alkaline nature of acetate anion, being the conjugate base of a weak acid, precludes its use. For this proof of concept study, LiTFSI was selected as it is relatively well studied and satisfies this criterion, having a pH near 4 at both 1m and 20m. The water-in-salt definition applies at concentrations above 5m, and at 20m, the ratio between Li+ and H2O is only ~1:2.78.To verify the feasibility of quinone-mediated CO2 capture in salt-concentrated aqueous media, CV scans were conducted using poly(1,4-anthraquinone)-carbon nanotube (PAQ-CNT) composite under both N2 and CO2 atmospheres. PAQ was selected for the reduced solubility compared to its molecular counterpart. The immobilization of PAQ on CNT through π−π interaction provides stable anchoring as well as fast electrical path (theoretical capacity = 260 mAh g−1, or 9.7 mmol CO2 g−1; structure shown in Supplementary Fig. 3)34. This material has recently been successfully employed by our group to demonstrate electro-swing-based CO2 separation in a parallel passage contactor configuration using an ionic liquid as the electrolyte16. Note that PAQ shows only a single, broad redox couple under N2 instead of two well-defined redox waves (as in the case of solution-phase molecular quinones), which can be ascribed to the slower electron exchange along the polymeric backbone and the hydrogen bonding effect of the aqueous media28,35. A substantial difference in electrochemical behavior can be seen in the presence of CO2 using LiTFSI-based electrolytes (Fig. 2c, d and at additional concentrations in Supplementary Fig. 4). The pronounced positive shift in the anodic peak is indicative of quinone bis(carbonate) formation, which requires extra driving force to be oxidized compared to quinone dianions. The successful formation of PAQ-CO2 adduct is also confirmed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), where the C1s spectrum of PAQ reduced in 20m LiTFSI under CO2 showed a close resemblance to that of PAQ-CO2 adduct obtained using a conventional organic electrolyte (Supplementary Fig. 5). Interestingly, the oxidation potential of the PAQ-CO2 adduct increases with increasing LiTFSI concentration. This is attributed to the stronger stabilization effect of Li+ on the adduct at higher solution molalities as confirmed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Note 1).Minimized competing reactions in salt-concentrated electrolyteTo understand the effect of possible competing reactions on the reactivity of PAQ with CO2, Fig. 3a shows the CV scans of PAQ under N2 in 1m NH4NO3 (pH adjusted to 4 with HNO3) and LiTFSI electrolytes with different molalities (pH ~ 4). It was previously established that protonation and cation association can stabilize reduced quinone species, inducing anodic shifts in the quinone reduction potential28. The reduction potential of PAQ in 1m NH4NO3 is significantly more positive than those in LiTFSI-based electrolytes. As NH4+ is generally regarded as a bulky cation with low tendency for anion association, the large anodic shift in the reduction potential in 1m NH4NO3 can only be ascribed to the protonation of reduced PAQ36. The protonation of reduced PAQ in 1m NH4NO3 electrolyte severely undermines its potential carbon capture ability, which can be corroborated by ill-defined adduct oxidation peaks in CV scans under CO2 (Supplementary Fig. 7).Fig. 3: Enhanced reactivity of CO2 with quinones in salt-concentrated media.a CV of PAQ-CNT in 1m NH4NO3, 1, 5 and 20m LiTFSI under N2. The scans were conducted at a rate 50 mV s−1. b The free energy change for LiTFSI dissociation at different electrolyte permittivities. Relative permittivities of 80 and 10 correspond to 1 and 20m LiTFSI, respectively. The process becomes nonspontaneous at high LiTFSI concentrations. c The free energy change for quinone-CO2 adduct formation at different electrolyte permittivities, starting from both AQ2– and AQ2– complexed with Li+. The adduct formation becomes thermodynamically more favorable at higher LiTFSI concentrations. d−f CV of PAQ-CNT at different scan rates in 1m NH4NO3 (d), 1m LiTFSI (e), and 20m LiTFSI (f) under CO2. The shaded area corresponds to the oxidation of quinone dianions that are unreacted with CO2. For all the CV measurements, PAQ was cast on glassy carbon at a loading of 0.042 mg cm−2, Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageProtonation is greatly suppressed in LiTFSI-based electrolytes where Li+ significantly outnumbers H+, rendering ion association the major competing reaction. Notably, though, both the onset and the peak potential of PAQ reduction shift towards more negative values with increasing LiTFSI concentrations (Fig. 3a), indicating weakened ion association. This is likely attributed to the dominance of associated salt species (contact ion pairs, CIP, and aggregates) in concentrated solutions as a result of incomplete cation solvation by water molecules26,31. To confirm this mechanistic interpretation, the free energy change (ΔG) for LiTFSI dissociation was calculated by DFT, where the increase in salt concentration can be modeled as a decrease in the dielectric constant of the electrolyte (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 8)37. The DFT results confirmed that the dissociation of LiTFSI becomes nonspontaneous (ΔG > 0) above a certain concentration threshold, such that the kinetics of Li+-involved processes are necessarily slowed down in a salt-concentrated environment. More importantly, the thermodynamic driving force for quinone-CO2 adduct formation, from both AQ2− and AQ2− complexed with Li+, also increases with increasing electrolyte concentrations based on the DFT calculations (Fig. 3c).This conclusion of enhanced reactivity of CO2 with quinones in salt-concentrated media can be seen experimentally by CV measurements under different scan rates (Fig. 3d−f). Interestingly, besides the oxidation of quinone-CO2 adduct, an additional oxidation peak at less positive potential can be seen during fast scans (shaded area in Fig. 3d−f), corresponding to the oxidation of quinone dianions that did not chemically react with CO2. Such a phenomenon is caused by the much more rapid electrochemical generation of reduced quinone species compared to the relatively slow CO2 transport and chemical reaction with reduced quinones, which inevitably becomes more pronounced with increasing scan rates. Quantitatively, while 100% of the electrochemically generated quinone dianions reacted with CO2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1 in LiTFSI-based electrolytes, the value was only 77.5% when using 1m NH4NO3 likely due to the rapid protonation; and compared to 1m LiTFSI, a higher percentage of adduct formation was observed in 20m LiTFSI under all scan rates, thanks to the suppressed Li+ association (Supplementary Fig. 9).Therefore, it is clear from the above discussion that the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones is much less susceptible to competing reactions when carried out in salt-concentrated aqueous media, making them particularly attractive for quinone-mediated carbon capture.Physicochemical advantages of salt-concentrated electrolyteIn addition to being fully compatible with quinone electrochemistry and minimizing competing reactions, concentrated LiTFSI aqueous electrolytes also possess favorable physicochemical properties for the practical applications of electrochemically mediated carbon capture.Firstly, salt-concentrated aqueous media demonstrate significantly enhanced resistance to evaporative loss compared to their dilute counterparts. Figure 4a plots the weight evolution of LiTFSI-based electrolytes under continuous, high-flow-rate gas sparging, where a stark contrast in water retention capability exists between the dilute (pure H2O, 1m LiTFSI) and the concentrated (10 and 20m LiTFSI) electrolytes. While pure water suffered from >56% weight loss (with respect to the initial electrolyte weight) after 168 h of gas purging, the value was merely 1.3% for 20m LiTFSI. This unique feature effectively dispels the traditional concern of electrolyte dry-out when interfacing aqueous solutions with gas flows, rendering the potential quinone-mediated carbon capture system with flexibility in form factor and durability.Fig. 4: Physicochemical advantages of salt-concentrated electrolytes for quinone-mediated CO2 capture.a Weight retention curves of different electrolytes under constant N2 sparging at a high flow rate of 200 mL min−1. b Hydroquinone solubility in a representative organic solvent (DMSO), pure water and 20m LiTFSI aqueous electrolyte. c Multicycle CV scans of PAQ-CNT in 0.1 M TBAPF6 DMSO electrolyte at a rate of 100 mV s−1. Inset shows the severe dissolution of PAQ (immobilized on carbon felt) into the electrolyte during electrochemical reduction in a DMSO-based electrolyte. d, e The 1st and 100th CV scans of PAQ-CNT under CO2 in 1m LiTFSI (d) and 20m LiTFSI (e) at a rate of 50 mV s−1. For all the CV measurements, PAQ was cast on glassy carbon, Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageSecondly, salt-concentrated aqueous media containing no free water inhibit the dissolution of electroactive compounds immobilized on heterogeneous substrates, which is desirable for capacity retention during electrochemical cycling of many systems. Quinones, especially in their reduced forms, generally show high dissolution tendency in polar electrolytes24,35,38. Correspondingly, hydroquinone was selected as a probe molecule, and its solubility in various electrolytes was determined via UV−Vis spectrometry (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). A high hydroquinone solubility of 463 mg mL−1 was observed in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) which is a representative organic solvent, resulting in visible PAQ dissolution and rapid capacity decay during electrochemical cycling (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 12). The solubility was decreased by fourfold when the organic solvent was replaced with water, yet the value remained significant. Therefore, ~35% capacity loss of PAQ-CNT (decrease in cathodic peak intensity) was seen after 100 CV cycles in 1m LiTFSI (Fig. 4d). Noticeably, compared to that in pure water, the solubility of hydroquinone was reduced even further by ~14 times in 20m LiTFSI. The greatly suppressed PAQ solubilization in salt-concentrated electrolytes, together with minimized side reactions, enabled impressive PAQ cycling stability (~90% capacity retention after 100 CV cycles, Fig. 4e).Electrochemical cycling with high capacity and stabilityTo further evaluate the electrochemical performance of quinone-mediated CO2 capture-release in salt-concentrated aqueous media, PAQ-CNT was immobilized on porous carbon felt substrates to increase both the active material mass loading and the electrode−electrolyte contact area. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was employed to quantify the CO2 uptake capacity (Supplementary Fig. 13). Specifically, the PAQ-CNT electrode was electrochemically reduced to capture CO2 and was then placed in a sealed vial for thermal regeneration. After release, the headspace was sampled using an FTIR gas cell to determine the CO2 concentration. The thermal release capacity (CO2 per gram of PAQ) was ~4.7 mmol g−1 at 80 °C and increased to ~6.2 mmol g−1 at 120 °C. Nevertheless, as observed in previous studies24,25, thermal regeneration is less effective than the electrochemical route such that only ~70% of the captured CO2 was liberated at 120 °C (Supplementary Fig. 14). Considering this thermal release inefficiency, the carbon capture capacity of PAQ is ~8.9 mmol g−1, which is close to its theoretical value of 9.7 mmol g−1.Figure 5a shows the electrochemical CO2 capture-release voltage profiles at different cycling currents in 20m LiTFSI electrolyte, where the PAQ electrode demonstrated excellent charge transfer kinetics. When cycled at a high current of 0.5 A g−1 (capture/release in ~30 min), a carbon capture capacity of ~8.4 mmol g−1 can be achieved (>86% of the theoretical value), which is higher than in the previously reported quinone-mediated carbon capture systems. Moreover, the value is on par with, if not higher than, the established amine-based processes (~8 mmol per gram of amine, but ~1−2 mmol per gram of the total scrubbing absorbent)24,39. Importantly, the capacity was only affected slightly with further increase in the cycling currents. For example, a working capacity of ~6.6 mmol g−1 could still be obtained when the capture/release process was completed in only ~6 min (2 A g−1). The quinone-mediated CO2 capture-release also demonstrated outstanding cycling stability and reversibility in salt-concentrated aqueous electrolytes (Fig. 5b). Minimal capacity loss can be observed after 150 cycles at a high current of 1.5 A g−1 (capture/release in ~10 min), with an average Coulombic efficiency (release capacity/capture capacity) of near unity.Fig. 5: Electrochemical carbon capture and release with high capacity and stability.a Electrochemical CO2 capture-release voltage profiles at different cycling current densities in 20m LiTFSI. b Long-term cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency of PAQ-CNT in 20m LiTFSI at a high current of 1.5 A g−1 (capture/release in ~10 min). For (a) and (b), the mass loading of PAQ on carbon felt was 0.2 mg cm−2, LiFePO4 on Al foil was used as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode, and the measurements were carried out in a conventional single-compartment electrochemical cell. c Schematic illustrating the configuration of the membrane flow cell for CO2 capture-release.

A hydrophobic gas diffusion layer (GDL) was placed on one side of the PAQ electrode and interfaced with continuous CO2 flow. d Long-term cycling stability of the membrane flow cell in 20m LiTFSI at a cycling current of 2 A g−1. For (b) and (d), PAQ reduction was carried out at constant current with a cut-off voltage of either −0.95 V vs. Ag/AgCl or −1.4 V vs. LiFePO4. The oxidation of PAQ-CO2 was conducted via the CC/CV mode (constant current followed by constant voltage). The cut-off voltage for CC oxidation was either 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl or −0.1 V vs. LiFePO4; and CV oxidation was carried out until the current decayed to 10% of the CC oxidation current. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo gain deeper insights into the electrochemical CO2 capture-release performance in a practical scenario, a prototypical membrane-based flow cell was constructed as shown schematically in Fig. 5c. LiFePO4 was chosen as the counter electrode due to its well-established Li+ intercalation−deintercalation electrochemistry in aqueous environments (~0.42 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 20m LiTFSI) with high reversibility and excellent electrokinetics39,40. The capacity of the LiFePO4 electrode was at least four times in excess of that of the PAQ-CNT electrode to minimize the polarization from the counter electrode. The shortened ion-transport distance between the electrodes and the continuous delivery of gas-phase CO2 enabled high-current carbon capture-release with increased active material mass loading41. At a current of 2 A g−1 and a mass loading of 1 mg cm−2, the membrane flow cell demonstrated over 100 cycles of continuous carbon capture and release with good capacity retention (Fig. 5d), highlighting the outstanding capacity, stability, and reversibility of quinone-mediated carbon capture in salt-concentrated aqueous media.CO2 response during electrochemical quinone cyclingFinally, we constructed a gas device to directly monitor the CO2 response in situ during quinone electrochemical cycling. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 6a. Briefly, the PAQ-LiFePO4 electrochemical cell was mounted on a gasket with CO2 flowing on one side. Gaseous CO2 can dissolve into the electrolyte, transport through the electrochemical cell via diffusion and outgas into the N2 sweep stream on the other side. The permeated CO2 was then carried towards an in-line gas analyzer to determine the concentration. The detailed configuration of the gas cell is provided as Supplementary Fig. 15.Fig. 6: CO2 response during electrochemical quinone cycling.a Schematic illustrating the setup for the in situ measurement of CO2 response during PAQ cycling. MFC stands for mass flow controller. The electrochemical cell consisted of PAQ-CNT (PAQ 1 mg cm−2) and LiFePO4 (8 mg cm−2) electrodes cast on 50 μm-thick carbon felt (2 cm × 2 cm in area), and the two electrodes were separated by a 20m LiTFSI-imbibed polypropylene separator. The electrochemical cell was mounted on a brass gasket with a 1 cm2 circular opening to the gas flow chamber, which also served as the current collector for the PAQ-CNT electrode. A titanium mesh with little impedance to gas flow was used as the current collector for LiFePO4. Pure CO2 flowed on one side of the electrochemical cell and pure N2 flowed on the other side to carry permeated CO2 to the in-line gas detector. The testing employed a “zero-gap” design where the electrochemical components were all in close contact, such that CO2 cross-over can only occur via dissolution-diffusion through the electrolyte. b CO2 permeation in response to the electrochemical cycling of the PAQ-LiFePO4 cell, and the corresponding oxidation/reduction charge profiles. c Detailed CO2 permeation behavior during one capture-release cycle marked with a dashed line in (b). The cycling was conducted following a constant voltage capture-release protocol (capture at −1.2 V for 10 min, release at 0 V for 10 min, rest 10 min). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageFigure 6b shows the CO2 concentration response of the gas device during constant voltage capture and release (each capture/release step was 10 min, followed by a 10-min rest), where a cyclic fluctuation of the permeated CO2 concentration can indeed be clearly observed. During capture, CO2 dissolved in the electrolyte was being actively consumed by the PAQ-CNT electrode, resulting in a continuous decrease in CO2 permeation; and the subsequent electrochemical oxidation of the PAQ-CO2 adduct generated CO2 rapidly, leading to a sharp concentration spike until all the captured CO2 was released and the permeation restored to its background value (Fig. 6c). Note that the discrepancy between the onset of the electrochemical capture/release and the CO2 signal response was due to system dispersion and the headspace volume of the flow chamber. Importantly, the consistent CO2 response over repeated electrochemical cycling further confirmed the stability of quinone chemistry for carbon capture in salt-concentrated aqueous media.System testing in the presence of oxygenThe potential parasitic reaction (peroxide formation) between reduced quinones and molecular oxygen (O2) present in the feed stream is generally regarded as a source of inefficiency in our described CO2 separation scheme13,17. Therefore, the electrochemical behavior of quinones in salt-concentrated aqueous electrolytes was further evaluated under mixed CO2/O2 conditions.It is worth emphasizing that electrochemically mediated carbon capture operates in a mass transfer-limited regime. Therefore, we can take advantage of the substantial solubility difference between O2 and CO2 to reduce the efficiency loss. For aqueous solutions at 25 °C, CO2 has ~26 times higher solubility than O2 under the same partial pressure42. While application for dilute scenarios such as direct air capture requires further investigation, we believe redox-active sorbents are competitive for carbon capture from stationary sources with relatively high CO2 partial pressure, such as carbon capture from power plants and large industrial processes (steel, cement and fertilizer plants, etc.), as well as in nonoxidizing environments (natural gas and biogas upgrading, etc.), which account for ~60% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions43. Flue gas from coal-fired power plants typically contains 12−15% CO2 and 3−5% O2; in other industrial plants, the CO2 concentration in exhaust streams can be even higher (e.g. cement production 15−30%, iron and steel 20−44%)43. Therefore, the limiting current involving CO2 can be two orders of magnitude higher than that involving O2 in our targeted carbon capture scenarios.The potential of the O2/O22− redox couple in 1 and 20m LiTFSI was studied using a glassy carbon electrode, which is known to catalyze the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, Fig. 7a). The ORR onset potential was relatively negative for both cases, which can be attributed to the limited proton availability. The reaction product is likely to be Li2O2, which has been observed to be stable in salt-concentrated aqueous media due to significantly reduced H2O activity40, making it a poor oxidant. Importantly, compared to 1m LiTFSI, the onset potential was 150 mV more negative in 20m LiTFSI together with reduced limiting current, further lowering the driving force for parasitic ORR. No obvious differences in CV can be observed for PAQ in 20m LiTFSI under N2 and O2 (Supplementary Fig. 16a). The ratio between the anodic and cathodic peak currents (Ipa/Ipc) is 0.98 and 0.97 under N2 and O2 respectively, confirming the relatively low sensitivity of reduced PAQ towards O2 in 20m LiTFSI. Redox-active sorbents with higher reduction potentials (e.g. 1,4-naphthoquinone, NQ, Supplementary Fig. 16b) can also be chosen to minimize side reactions.Fig. 7: Electrochemical CO2 capture-release in the presence of O2.a Linear sweep voltammograms of 1 and 20m LiTFSI saturated with O2 measured with a glassy carbon electrode at a rate of 10 mV s−1. b Comparison between the oxidation potential of PAQ-CO2 (with onset potential noted) and the ORR potential (from a) in 1 and 20m LiTFSI. c Reduction profiles of PAQ under CO2 in 20m LiTFSI and of the same electrode after being rested in 100% O2 (15 min), air (15 min) and 3% O2 (1 h), respectively. The reductions were carried out at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 and the PAQ was immobilized on carbon felt at a mass loading of 1.2 mg cm−2. d CV scans of PAQ under pure CO2 and simulated flue gas in 20m LiTFSI. The ratio between the total anodic and cathodic capacities was 87.3% and 80.7% for pure CO2 and simulated flue gas, respectively. The additional anodic peak observed under simulated flue gas corresponds to the oxidation of quinone anions that did not react with CO2 due to mass transport limitation. For (b) and (d), the CV scans were conducted at a rate of 10 mV s−1 with 1.5 μg PAQ loaded on the glassy carbon electrode. e The capture-release capacity of PAQ during continuous cycling under simulated flue gas. The cycling was carried out in the membrane flow cell configuration at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 and a PAQ mass loading of 0.5 mg cm−2 (immobilized on carbon felt). CC capture and CC/CV release protocol was adopted with the cut-off voltage being −1.35 and −0.1 V, respectively. Each capture/release step has a time scale of ~15 min. Source data a\n",

      "AbstractCarbon capture is essential for mitigating carbon dioxide emissions. Compared to conventional chemical scrubbing, electrochemically mediated carbon capture utilizing redox-active sorbents such as quinones is emerging as a more versatile and economical alternative. However, the practicality of such systems is hindered by the requirement of toxic, flammable organic electrolytes or often costly ionic liquids. Herein, we demonstrate that rationally designed aqueous electrolytes with high salt concentration can effectively resolve the incompatibility between aqueous environments and quinone electrochemistry for carbon capture, eliminating the safety, toxicity, and at least partially the cost concerns in previous studies. Salt-concentrated aqueous media also offer distinct advantages including extended electrochemical window, high carbon dioxide activity, significantly reduced evaporative loss and material dissolution, and importantly, greatly suppressed competing reactions including under simulated flue gas. Correspondingly, we achieve continuous carbon capture-release operations with outstanding capacity, stability, efficiency and electrokinetics, advancing electrochemical carbon separation further towards practical applications.\n",
      "IntroductionAnthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions present a serious challenge to our society. One of the foremost mitigation strategies involves carbon capture, particularly from large stationary emission sources, followed by sequestration or utilization1,2,3,4,5. The incumbent technology for carbon capture is wet chemical scrubbing, which utilizes aqueous amines to chemically absorb CO2 and subsequently release it by desorption via a temperature-swing process. However, this process is challenged by the substantial energy demand associated with the regeneration step, sorbent degradation, corrosion, environmental concerns and large footprint3,6. To this end, emerging materials such as water-lean solvents and porous solid sorbents have also been garnering widespread attention, with many showing promising capture properties7,8,9,10. Nevertheless, most of these CO2 storing materials are still reliant on high pressure and/or temperature-swing conditions during their operation cycles10. Electrochemically mediated separations offer a low-temperature, ambient-pressure alternative for carbon capture, representing a promising yet largely unchartered research area11,12,13,14,15,16. By being electrically driven, these systems can be controlled precisely to reduce energy losses, are modular and thus easy to implement in a variety of locations, and possess great adaptability to the multiscale nature of carbon capture.In one form of electrochemically mediated carbon capture, redox-active organic compounds serve as CO2 carriers. Electrochemical reduction of these compounds generates nucleophiles with a high binding affinity towards electrophilic CO2 to afford stable sorbent-CO2 adducts; subsequently, the adducts can be oxidized to liberate pure CO2 while regenerating the sorbents13. To date, several classes of redox-active compounds have been explored, with quinoid species being the most representative example16,17,18,19,20. Quinones are a class of cyclic compounds containing two carbonyl groups in an unsaturated six-membered ring structure, which have been studied extensively for their key roles in biological electron transport as well as for promising applications in catalysis and energy storage21. They are versatile molecules with highly tailorable electrochemical properties through molecular engineering and can be synthesized from inexpensive commodity chemicals, which is favorable for large-scale applications22. Moreover, quinones as CO2 sorbents can have an appealingly high theoretical capacity of two CO2 equivalents per molecule, compared to conventional wet scrubbing which requires two equivalents of amine to capture one equivalent of CO2. Mizen and Wrighton23 first reported that electrogenerated 9,10-phenanthrenequinone dianion can chemically react with CO2 in homogeneous solutions to yield bis(carbonate), and further studies expanded the quinone chemistries for reversible CO2 capture-release16,17,18,24,25. Despite this progress, electrochemically mediated CO2 separations still need to be operated using mainly flammable, toxic aprotic organic electrolytes, posing a great barrier toward practical implementation13. Recently, the relatively benign ionic liquids have also been explored as electrolytes for electrochemically mediated CO2 separations16,18. While it may not be a major issue for batch-based separation processes with lean electrolytes, the often-expensive ionic liquids can raise serious cost concerns in continuous-flow absorption systems where they are needed in excess for the dissolution of redox-active CO2 carriers.An aqueous electrolyte is the ideal medium for large-scale electrochemical systems, offering distinct advantages in cost, safety, environmental benignity, and ease of device construction. Carbon capture via redox-active sorbents in aqueous electrolytes is, however, confronted with serious challenges. One critical limitation originates from the narrow electrochemical stability window of water, which is insufficient to support the reductive addition of CO2 to quinone molecules without incurring parasitic reactions (hydrogen evolution)23,26. Compared to aprotic solvents, aqueous media are complicated by the speciation of CO2 upon dissolution, which can undermine the activity of dissolved molecular CO2 given inappropriate solution pH15. Importantly, various competing reactions with reduced quinone molecules are expected in aqueous solutions, particularly protonation and ion association, hindering severely the kinetics and efficiency of carbon capture13,27,28,29. Finally, rapid evaporative loss is a long-standing concern when interfacing aqueous electrolytes with continuous gas flow, which can seriously compromise the service life of the electrochemical systems30.Herein, by drawing inspiration from the recent breakthrough in salt-concentrated electrolytes for battery applications, we develop an aqueous electrolyte formulation that is fully compatible with quinone-mediated electrochemical carbon capture26,30,31,32. Salt-concentrated aqueous electrolytes, also known as “water-in-salt” electrolytes, are defined as those in which dissolved salt outnumbers water by both mass and volume26. In these solutions, the number of water molecules is insufficient to fully solvate the cations so that no free-state water exists, which can effectively suppress the activity of water molecules to extend the electrochemical stability window. By selecting appropriate salt species, desirable solution pH can be realized so that the total dissolved inorganic carbon is composed primarily of molecular CO2. It is worthwhile highlighting that, compared to their dilute counterpart, reduced quinone dianions are thermodynamically more reactive towards CO2 and less prone to competing reactions in salt-concentrated electrolytes, due to the modified dielectric environment. This results in enhanced carbon capture kinetics and capacity, as verified by both experiments and theoretical calculations. Additional technical superiorities, including high water retention under continuous gas sparging, and diminished dissolution of electrode-immobilized quinone molecules compared to organic electrolytes, are also observed when using our salt-concentrated electrolyte system. These multifold advantages enable the demonstration of quinone-meditated CO2 capture-release with excellent capacity, kinetics, reversibility and stability in aqueous media, advancing electrochemical carbon separation further towards practical applications.ResultsElectrochemistry of quinone-mediated CO2 captureFigure 1a shows the overall reaction of quinone-mediated CO2 capture and release, using anthraquinone (AQ) as an example. In aprotic media absent of electrophiles, quinones typically undergo two successive one-electron reductions (Fig. 1b, N2, and further illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 1), corresponding to the reversible formation of semiquinone radical anion (AQ•–) and quinone dianion (AQ2–). Interestingly, only a single reduction wave can be observed in the presence of electrophilic CO2 and the current nearly doubles with respect to that under N2 at the first reduction potential (Fig. 1b, CO2), indicating the interaction between reduced quinones and CO2. The complexation of CO2 with quinone is believed to proceed via an ECEC mechanism (E, electron transfer; C, chemical reaction)33. Namely, the reduction of AQ affords AQ•–, which can react chemically with CO2 through nucleophilic addition; the resulting carbonate renders the quinone aromatic ring relatively neutral such that the second electron transfer can occur at nearly the same potential, generating one additional nucleophilic oxygen for CO2 attachment (Supplementary Fig. 2).Fig. 1: Electrochemistry of quinone-mediated CO2 capture.a The overall reductive addition reaction between CO2 and AQ. b CV of AQ in an aprotic organic solvent with and without CO2. The CV scans were carried out in 5 mM AQ in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) supporting salt. Glassy carbon was used as the working electrode, Pt wire as the counter electrode, Ag wire as a pseudo-reference electrode, and 1 mM ferrocene (Fc) as an internal reference. The scan rate was 50 mV s−1. c Major competing reactions when carrying out quinone-mediated CO2 capture in aqueous media.Full size imageSimilar electrochemical behavior is also commonly observed in protic electrolytes, where reduced quinones can react with protons to form hydroxyl groups via a two-electron reduction process22. Correspondingly, one immediate hurdle when attempting to carry out quinone-mediated carbon capture in aqueous solutions is the rapid protonation of the reduced quinone molecules (Fig. 1c). For example, the rate constant for AQ2− protonation was determined to be twice that of the reaction with CO2, such that full utilization of the carbon capture capacity is hardly achievable in the presence of proton donors27. Moreover, since both the tendency for quinone protonation and the activity of dissolved molecular CO2 increase with increasing solution acidity, an obvious dilemma is presented for aqueous electrolyte formulation. In addition to protonation through the formation of covalent bonds, cations in the supporting electrolyte can also stabilize quinone anions via Coulombic ion pairing (Fig. 1c), which may further reduce the driving force for CO2 complexation29.Aqueous electrolyte for quinone-mediated CO2 captureThe prerequisite for quinone-mediated CO2 capture-release in aqueous media is a wide electrochemical stability window of the electrolytes. Since only reduced quinones with sufficient electron density can undergo nucleophilic addition with molecular CO2, the formation of quinone-CO2 adducts generally occurs at potentials more negative than the reductive decomposition (hydrogen evolution reaction) potential of water33. Figure 2a compares the cyclic voltammogram (CV) of AQ under CO2 with the stability window of 1m LiTFSI aqueous solution (where m is molality and LiTFSI represents lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide). The reduction peak of AQ occurred at ~0.88 V vs. Ag/AgCl, whereas the electrolyte started to decompose as early as –0.81 V vs. Ag/AgCl (defined as the potential where the current density reaches 0.01 mA cm–2).Fig. 2: Rational electrolyte formulation for quinone-mediated CO2 capture in aqueous media.a Linear sweep voltammetry of 1 and 20m LiTFSI aqueous electrolytes at a rate of 1 mV s−1, compared with the CV of AQ under CO2.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageSalt-concentrated electrolytes, recently gaining momentum in battery research, are proposed to offer an extended electrochemical stability window by eliminating the presence of free-state water through cation solvation26,30,31,32. For example, when the concentration of LiTFSI was increased to an ultrahigh level of 20m, the cathodic decomposition potential of the electrolyte was shifted to –1.11 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which is sufficient to envelop the electrochemical capture and release of CO2 by quinones.To ensure high solubility, salt species with stable and charge-delocalized anions, such as acetate, TFSI, trifluoromethanesulfonate, and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide, are preferred when formulating water-in-salt electrolytes31. Nevertheless, not all of these salts are compatible with electrochemically mediated carbon capture. Gaseous CO2 has many possible transformations upon dissolution in water, yet only dissolved molecular CO2(aq) is active towards complexation with reduced quinones (Fig. 2b). Therefore, electrolytes for electrochemically mediated carbon capture should have a pH value of less than 6 to ensure the dominance of CO2(aq)15. The alkaline nature of acetate anion, being the conjugate base of a weak acid, precludes its use. For this proof of concept study, LiTFSI was selected as it is relatively well studied and satisfies this criterion, having a pH near 4 at both 1m and 20m. The water-in-salt definition applies at concentrations above 5m, and at 20m, the ratio between Li+ and H2O is only ~1:2.78.To verify the feasibility of quinone-mediated CO2 capture in salt-concentrated aqueous media, CV scans were conducted using poly(1,4-anthraquinone)-carbon nanotube (PAQ-CNT) composite under both N2 and CO2 atmospheres. PAQ was selected for the reduced solubility compared to its molecular counterpart. The immobilization of PAQ on CNT through π−π interaction provides stable anchoring as well as fast electrical path (theoretical capacity = 260 mAh g−1, or 9.7 mmol CO2 g−1; structure shown in Supplementary Fig. 3)34. This material has recently been successfully employed by our group to demonstrate electro-swing-based CO2 separation in a parallel passage contactor configuration using an ionic liquid as the electrolyte16. Note that PAQ shows only a single, broad redox couple under N2 instead of two well-defined redox waves (as in the case of solution-phase molecular quinones), which can be ascribed to the slower electron exchange along the polymeric backbone and the hydrogen bonding effect of the aqueous media28,35. A substantial difference in electrochemical behavior can be seen in the presence of CO2 using LiTFSI-based electrolytes (Fig. 2c, d and at additional concentrations in Supplementary Fig. 4). The pronounced positive shift in the anodic peak is indicative of quinone bis(carbonate) formation, which requires extra driving force to be oxidized compared to quinone dianions. The successful formation of PAQ-CO2 adduct is also confirmed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), where the C1s spectrum of PAQ reduced in 20m LiTFSI under CO2 showed a close resemblance to that of PAQ-CO2 adduct obtained using a conventional organic electrolyte (Supplementary Fig. 5). Interestingly, the oxidation potential of the PAQ-CO2 adduct increases with increasing LiTFSI concentration. This is attributed to the stronger stabilization effect of Li+ on the adduct at higher solution molalities as confirmed by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Note 1).Minimized competing reactions in salt-concentrated electrolyteTo understand the effect of possible competing reactions on the reactivity of PAQ with CO2, Fig. 3a shows the CV scans of PAQ under N2 in 1m NH4NO3 (pH adjusted to 4 with HNO3) and LiTFSI electrolytes with different molalities (pH ~ 4). It was previously established that protonation and cation association can stabilize reduced quinone species, inducing anodic shifts in the quinone reduction potential28. The reduction potential of PAQ in 1m NH4NO3 is significantly more positive than those in LiTFSI-based electrolytes. As NH4+ is generally regarded as a bulky cation with low tendency for anion association, the large anodic shift in the reduction potential in 1m NH4NO3 can only be ascribed to the protonation of reduced PAQ36. The protonation of reduced PAQ in 1m NH4NO3 electrolyte severely undermines its potential carbon capture ability, which can be corroborated by ill-defined adduct oxidation peaks in CV scans under CO2 (Supplementary Fig. 7).Fig. 3: Enhanced reactivity of CO2 with quinones in salt-concentrated media.a CV of PAQ-CNT in 1m NH4NO3, 1, 5 and 20m LiTFSI under N2. The scans were conducted at a rate 50 mV s−1. b The free energy change for LiTFSI dissociation at different electrolyte permittivities. Relative permittivities of 80 and 10 correspond to 1 and 20m LiTFSI, respectively. The process becomes nonspontaneous at high LiTFSI concentrations. c The free energy change for quinone-CO2 adduct formation at different electrolyte permittivities, starting from both AQ2– and AQ2– complexed with Li+. The adduct formation becomes thermodynamically more favorable at higher LiTFSI concentrations. d−f CV of PAQ-CNT at different scan rates in 1m NH4NO3 (d), 1m LiTFSI (e), and 20m LiTFSI (f) under CO2. The shaded area corresponds to the oxidation of quinone dianions that are unreacted with CO2. For all the CV measurements, PAQ was cast on glassy carbon at a loading of 0.042 mg cm−2, Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageProtonation is greatly suppressed in LiTFSI-based electrolytes where Li+ significantly outnumbers H+, rendering ion association the major competing reaction. Notably, though, both the onset and the peak potential of PAQ reduction shift towards more negative values with increasing LiTFSI concentrations (Fig. 3a), indicating weakened ion association. This is likely attributed to the dominance of associated salt species (contact ion pairs, CIP, and aggregates) in concentrated solutions as a result of incomplete cation solvation by water molecules26,31. To confirm this mechanistic interpretation, the free energy change (ΔG) for LiTFSI dissociation was calculated by DFT, where the increase in salt concentration can be modeled as a decrease in the dielectric constant of the electrolyte (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 8)37. The DFT results confirmed that the dissociation of LiTFSI becomes nonspontaneous (ΔG > 0) above a certain concentration threshold, such that the kinetics of Li+-involved processes are necessarily slowed down in a salt-concentrated environment. More importantly, the thermodynamic driving force for quinone-CO2 adduct formation, from both AQ2− and AQ2− complexed with Li+, also increases with increasing electrolyte concentrations based on the DFT calculations (Fig. 3c).This conclusion of enhanced reactivity of CO2 with quinones in salt-concentrated media can be seen experimentally by CV measurements under different scan rates (Fig. 3d−f). Interestingly, besides the oxidation of quinone-CO2 adduct, an additional oxidation peak at less positive potential can be seen during fast scans (shaded area in Fig. 3d−f), corresponding to the oxidation of quinone dianions that did not chemically react with CO2. Such a phenomenon is caused by the much more rapid electrochemical generation of reduced quinone species compared to the relatively slow CO2 transport and chemical reaction with reduced quinones, which inevitably becomes more pronounced with increasing scan rates. Quantitatively, while 100% of the electrochemically generated quinone dianions reacted with CO2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s–1 in LiTFSI-based electrolytes, the value was only 77.5% when using 1m NH4NO3 likely due to the rapid protonation; and compared to 1m LiTFSI, a higher percentage of adduct formation was observed in 20m LiTFSI under all scan rates, thanks to the suppressed Li+ association (Supplementary Fig. 9).Therefore, it is clear from the above discussion that the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones is much less susceptible to competing reactions when carried out in salt-concentrated aqueous media, making them particularly attractive for quinone-mediated carbon capture.Physicochemical advantages of salt-concentrated electrolyteIn addition to being fully compatible with quinone electrochemistry and minimizing competing reactions, concentrated LiTFSI aqueous electrolytes also possess favorable physicochemical properties for the practical applications of electrochemically mediated carbon capture.Firstly, salt-concentrated aqueous media demonstrate significantly enhanced resistance to evaporative loss compared to their dilute counterparts. Figure 4a plots the weight evolution of LiTFSI-based electrolytes under continuous, high-flow-rate gas sparging, where a stark contrast in water retention capability exists between the dilute (pure H2O, 1m LiTFSI) and the concentrated (10 and 20m LiTFSI) electrolytes. While pure water suffered from >56% weight loss (with respect to the initial electrolyte weight) after 168 h of gas purging, the value was merely 1.3% for 20m LiTFSI. This unique feature effectively dispels the traditional concern of electrolyte dry-out when interfacing aqueous solutions with gas flows, rendering the potential quinone-mediated carbon capture system with flexibility in form factor and durability.Fig. 4: Physicochemical advantages of salt-concentrated electrolytes for quinone-mediated CO2 capture.a Weight retention curves of different electrolytes under constant N2 sparging at a high flow rate of 200 mL min−1. b Hydroquinone solubility in a representative organic solvent (DMSO), pure water and 20m LiTFSI aqueous electrolyte. c Multicycle CV scans of PAQ-CNT in 0.1 M TBAPF6 DMSO electrolyte at a rate of 100 mV s−1. Inset shows the severe dissolution of PAQ (immobilized on carbon felt) into the electrolyte during electrochemical reduction in a DMSO-based electrolyte. d, e The 1st and 100th CV scans of PAQ-CNT under CO2 in 1m LiTFSI (d) and 20m LiTFSI (e) at a rate of 50 mV s−1. For all the CV measurements, PAQ was cast on glassy carbon, Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageSecondly, salt-concentrated aqueous media containing no free water inhibit the dissolution of electroactive compounds immobilized on heterogeneous substrates, which is desirable for capacity retention during electrochemical cycling of many systems. Quinones, especially in their reduced forms, generally show high dissolution tendency in polar electrolytes24,35,38. Correspondingly, hydroquinone was selected as a probe molecule, and its solubility in various electrolytes was determined via UV−Vis spectrometry (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). A high hydroquinone solubility of 463 mg mL−1 was observed in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) which is a representative organic solvent, resulting in visible PAQ dissolution and rapid capacity decay during electrochemical cycling (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 12). The solubility was decreased by fourfold when the organic solvent was replaced with water, yet the value remained significant. Therefore, ~35% capacity loss of PAQ-CNT (decrease in cathodic peak intensity) was seen after 100 CV cycles in 1m LiTFSI (Fig. 4d). Noticeably, compared to that in pure water, the solubility of hydroquinone was reduced even further by ~14 times in 20m LiTFSI. The greatly suppressed PAQ solubilization in salt-concentrated electrolytes, together with minimized side reactions, enabled impressive PAQ cycling stability (~90% capacity retention after 100 CV cycles, Fig. 4e).Electrochemical cycling with high capacity and stabilityTo further evaluate the electrochemical performance of quinone-mediated CO2 capture-release in salt-concentrated aqueous media, PAQ-CNT was immobilized on porous carbon felt substrates to increase both the active material mass loading and the electrode−electrolyte contact area. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was employed to quantify the CO2 uptake capacity (Supplementary Fig. 13). Specifically, the PAQ-CNT electrode was electrochemically reduced to capture CO2 and was then placed in a sealed vial for thermal regeneration. After release, the headspace was sampled using an FTIR gas cell to determine the CO2 concentration. The thermal release capacity (CO2 per gram of PAQ) was ~4.7 mmol g−1 at 80 °C and increased to ~6.2 mmol g−1 at 120 °C. Nevertheless, as observed in previous studies24,25, thermal regeneration is less effective than the electrochemical route such that only ~70% of the captured CO2 was liberated at 120 °C (Supplementary Fig. 14). Considering this thermal release inefficiency, the carbon capture capacity of PAQ is ~8.9 mmol g−1, which is close to its theoretical value of 9.7 mmol g−1.Figure 5a shows the electrochemical CO2 capture-release voltage profiles at different cycling currents in 20m LiTFSI electrolyte, where the PAQ electrode demonstrated excellent charge transfer kinetics. When cycled at a high current of 0.5 A g−1 (capture/release in ~30 min), a carbon capture capacity of ~8.4 mmol g−1 can be achieved (>86% of the theoretical value), which is higher than in the previously reported quinone-mediated carbon capture systems. Moreover, the value is on par with, if not higher than, the established amine-based processes (~8 mmol per gram of amine, but ~1−2 mmol per gram of the total scrubbing absorbent)24,39. Importantly, the capacity was only affected slightly with further increase in the cycling currents. For example, a working capacity of ~6.6 mmol g−1 could still be obtained when the capture/release process was completed in only ~6 min (2 A g−1). The quinone-mediated CO2 capture-release also demonstrated outstanding cycling stability and reversibility in salt-concentrated aqueous electrolytes (Fig. 5b). Minimal capacity loss can be observed after 150 cycles at a high current of 1.5 A g−1 (capture/release in ~10 min), with an average Coulombic efficiency (release capacity/capture capacity) of near unity.Fig. 5: Electrochemical carbon capture and release with high capacity and stability.a Electrochemical CO2 capture-release voltage profiles at different cycling current densities in 20m LiTFSI. b Long-term cycling stability and Coulombic efficiency of PAQ-CNT in 20m LiTFSI at a high current of 1.5 A g−1 (capture/release in ~10 min). For (a) and (b), the mass loading of PAQ on carbon felt was 0.2 mg cm−2, LiFePO4 on Al foil was used as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode, and the measurements were carried out in a conventional single-compartment electrochemical cell. c Schematic illustrating the configuration of the membrane flow cell for CO2 capture-release. PAQ was immobilized on carbon felt at a mass loading of 1 mg cm−2, LiFePO4 coated on Al foil was used as the counter electrode, and the two electrodes were separated by an electrolyte-imbibed glass fiber membrane. A hydrophobic gas diffusion layer (GDL) was placed on one side of the PAQ electrode and interfaced with continuous CO2 flow. d Long-term cycling stability of the membrane flow cell in 20m LiTFSI at a cycling current of 2 A g−1. For (b) and (d), PAQ reduction was carried out at constant current with a cut-off voltage of either −0.95 V vs. Ag/AgCl or −1.4 V vs. LiFePO4. The oxidation of PAQ-CO2 was conducted via the CC/CV mode (constant current followed by constant voltage). The cut-off voltage for CC oxidation was either 0.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl or −0.1 V vs. LiFePO4; and CV oxidation was carried out until the current decayed to 10% of the CC oxidation current. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageTo gain deeper insights into the electrochemical CO2 capture-release performance in a practical scenario, a prototypical membrane-based flow cell was constructed as shown schematically in Fig. 5c. LiFePO4 was chosen as the counter electrode due to its well-established Li+ intercalation−deintercalation electrochemistry in aqueous environments (~0.42 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 20m LiTFSI) with high reversibility and excellent electrokinetics39,40. The capacity of the LiFePO4 electrode was at least four times in excess of that of the PAQ-CNT electrode to minimize the polarization from the counter electrode. The shortened ion-transport distance between the electrodes and the continuous delivery of gas-phase CO2 enabled high-current carbon capture-release with increased active material mass loading41. At a current of 2 A g−1 and a mass loading of 1 mg cm−2, the membrane flow cell demonstrated over 100 cycles of continuous carbon capture and release with good capacity retention (Fig. 5d), highlighting the outstanding capacity, stability, and reversibility of quinone-mediated carbon capture in salt-concentrated aqueous media.CO2 response during electrochemical quinone cyclingFinally, we constructed a gas device to directly monitor the CO2 response in situ during quinone electrochemical cycling. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 6a. Briefly, the PAQ-LiFePO4 electrochemical cell was mounted on a gasket with CO2 flowing on one side. Gaseous CO2 can dissolve into the electrolyte, transport through the electrochemical cell via diffusion and outgas into the N2 sweep stream on the other side. The permeated CO2 was then carried towards an in-line gas analyzer to determine the concentration. The detailed configuration of the gas cell is provided as Supplementary Fig. 15.Fig. 6: CO2 response during electrochemical quinone cycling.a Schematic illustrating the setup for the in situ measurement of CO2 response during PAQ cycling. MFC stands for mass flow controller. The electrochemical cell consisted of PAQ-CNT (PAQ 1 mg cm−2) and LiFePO4 (8 mg cm−2) electrodes cast on 50 μm-thick carbon felt (2 cm × 2 cm in area), and the two electrodes were separated by a 20m LiTFSI-imbibed polypropylene separator. The electrochemical cell was mounted on a brass gasket with a 1 cm2 circular opening to the gas flow chamber, which also served as the current collector for the PAQ-CNT electrode. A titanium mesh with little impedance to gas flow was used as the current collector for LiFePO4. Pure CO2 flowed on one side of the electrochemical cell and pure N2 flowed on the other side to carry permeated CO2 to the in-line gas detector. The testing employed a “zero-gap” design where the electrochemical components were all in close contact, such that CO2 cross-over can only occur via dissolution-diffusion through the electrolyte. b CO2 permeation in response to the electrochemical cycling of the PAQ-LiFePO4 cell, and the corresponding oxidation/reduction charge profiles. c Detailed CO2 permeation behavior during one capture-release cycle marked with a dashed line in (b). The cycling was conducted following a constant voltage capture-release protocol (capture at −1.2 V for 10 min, release at 0 V for 10 min, rest 10 min). Source data are provided as a Source Data file.Full size imageFigure 6b shows the CO2 concentration response of the gas device during constant voltage capture and release (each capture/release step was 10 min, followed by a 10-min rest), where a cyclic fluctuation of the permeated CO2 concentration can indeed be clearly observed. During capture, CO2 dissolved in the electrolyte was being actively consumed by the PAQ-CNT electrode, resulting in a continuous decrease in CO2 permeation; and the subsequent electrochemical oxidation of the PAQ-CO2 adduct generated CO2 rapidly, leading to a sharp concentration spike until all the captured CO2 was released and the permeation restored to its background value (Fig. 6c). Note that the discrepancy between the onset of the electrochemical capture/release and the CO2 signal response was due to system dispersion and the headspace volume of the flow chamber. Importantly, the consistent CO2 response over repeated electrochemical cycling further confirmed the stability of quinone chemistry for carbon capture in salt-concentrated aqueous media.System testing in the presence of oxygenThe potential parasitic reaction (peroxide formation) between reduced quinones and molecular oxygen (O2) present in the feed stream is generally regarded as a source of inefficiency in our described CO2 separation scheme13,17. Therefore, the electrochemical behavior of quinones in salt-concentrated aqueous electrolytes was further evaluated under mixed CO2/O2 conditions.It is worth emphasizing that electrochemically mediated carbon capture operates in a mass transfer-limited regime. Therefore, we can take advantage of the substantial solubility difference between O2 and CO2 to reduce the efficiency loss. For aqueous solutions at 25 °C, CO2 has ~26 times higher solubility than O2 under the same partial pressure42. While application for dilute scenarios such as direct air capture requires further investigation, we believe redox-active sorbents are competitive for carbon capture from stationary sources with relatively high CO2 partial pressure, such as carbon capture from power plants and large industrial processes (steel, cement and fertilizer plants, etc.), as well as in nonoxidizing environments (natural gas and biogas upgrading, etc.), which account for ~60% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions43. Flue gas from coal-fired power plants typically contains 12−15% CO2 and 3−5% O2; in other industrial plants, the CO2 concentration in exhaust streams can be even higher (e.g. cement production 15−30%, iron and steel 20−44%)43. Therefore, the limiting current involving CO2 can be two orders of magnitude higher than that involving O2 in our targeted carbon capture scenarios.The potential of the O2/O22− redox couple in 1 and 20m LiTFSI was studied using a glassy carbon electrode, which is known to catalyze the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR, Fig. 7a). The ORR onset potential was relatively negative for both cases, which can be attributed to the limited proton availability. The reaction product is likely to be Li2O2, which has been observed to be stable in salt-concentrated aqueous media due to significantly reduced H2O activity40, making it a poor oxidant. Importantly, compared to 1m LiTFSI, the onset potential was 150 mV more negative in 20m LiTFSI together with reduced limiting current, further lowering the driving force for parasitic ORR. No obvious differences in CV can be observed for PAQ in 20m LiTFSI under N2 and O2 (Supplementary Fig. 16a). The ratio between the anodic and cathodic peak currents (Ipa/Ipc) is 0.98 and 0.97 under N2 and O2 respectively, confirming the relatively low sensitivity of reduced PAQ towards O2 in 20m LiTFSI. Redox-active sorbents with higher reduction potentials (e.g. 1,4-naphthoquinone, NQ, Supplementary Fig. 16b) can also be chosen to minimize side reactions.Fig. 7: Electrochemical CO2 capture-release in the presence of O2.a Linear sweep voltammograms of 1 and 20m LiTFSI saturated with O2 measured with a glassy carbon electrode at a rate of 10 mV s−1. b Comparison between the oxidation potential of PAQ-CO2 (with onset potential noted) and the ORR potential (from a) in 1 and 20m LiTFSI. c Reduction profiles of PAQ under CO2 in 20m LiTFSI and of the same electrode after being rested in 100% O2 (15 min), air (15 min) and 3% O2 (1 h), respectively. The reductions were carried out at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 and the PAQ was immobilized on carbon felt at a mass loading of 1.2 mg cm−2. d CV scans of PAQ under pure CO2 and simulated flue gas in 20m LiTFSI. The ratio between the total anodic and cathodic capacities was 87.3% and 80.7% for pure CO2 and simulated flue gas, respectively. The additional anodic peak observed under simulated flue gas corresponds to the oxidation of quinone anions that did not react with CO2 due to mass transport limitation. For (b) and (d), the CV scans were conducted at a rate of 10 mV s−1 with 1.5 μg PAQ loaded on the glassy carbon electrode. e The capture-release capacity of PAQ during continuous cycling under simulated flue gas. The cycling was carried out in the membrane flow cell configuration at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 and a PAQ mass loading of 0.5 mg cm−2 (immobilized on carbon felt). CC capture and CC/CV release protocol was adopted with the cut-off voltage being −1.35 and −0.1 V, respectively. Each capture/release step has a time scale of ~15 min. Source data a \n",

      "The unprecedented increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration calls for effective carbon capture technologies. With distributed sources contributing to about half of the overall emission, CO2 capture from the atmosphere [direct air capture, (DAC)] is more relevant than ever. Herein, an electrochemically mediated DAC system is reported which utilizes affinity of redox-active quinone moieties towards CO2 molecules, and unlike incumbent chemisorption technologies which require temperature or pH swing, relies solely on the electrochemical voltage for CO2 capture and release. The design and operation of a DAC system is demonstrated with stackable bipolar cells using quinone chemistry. Specifically, poly(vinylanthraquinone) (PVAQ) negative electrode undergoes a two-electron reduction reaction and reversibly complexes with CO2, leading to CO2 sequestration from the feed stream. The subsequent PVAQ oxidation, conversely, results in release of CO2. The performance of both small- and meso-scale cells for DAC are evaluated with feed CO2 concentrations as low as 400 ppm (0.04 %), and energy consumption is demonstrated as low as 113 kJ per mole of CO2 captured. Notably, the bipolar cell construct is modular and expandable, equally suitable for small and large plants. Moving forward, this work presents a viable and highly customizable electrochemical method for DAC.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "The unprecedented increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gasses (specifically CO2) with its direct effect on global climate patterns is of major concern for the 21st century. Atmospheric CO2 levels which remained constant at around 280 ppm in the preindustrial era, have grown over recent decades to exceed 400 ppm, and the trajectory of ever-increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions suggests that the CO2 level could be nearly doubled within this century.1, 2 The upper boundary of CO2 concentration to avoid catastrophic climate and environmental changes was estimated to be around 500 ppm by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,3 and we are approaching this limit at an alarming rate. Therefore, a multitude of technologies have been developed in an effort to mitigate CO2 emissions: from solvent scrubbing4 and oxy-fuel combustion5 to thermal6, 7 or electrochemical methods8, 9 for CO2 capture from the point sources (such as power plants) that are mostly responsible for the rise of atmospheric CO2 concentration.\n",
      "A significant contribution (roughly half) to overall CO2 emissions can be attributed to distributed sources, and thus removal of existing CO2 from air (often noted as direct air capture, or DAC) is also essential for ensuring the CO2 levels do not go beyond the targeted range.10 DAC is a potential solution for climate change mitigation, with a number of technologies moving towards commercialization. While the applicability of DAC still requires validation, recent techno-economic assessments suggest reduction in CO2 capture costs when implemented on a large-scale.11 As the CO2 concentration in ambient air is extremely dilute, chemisorbents with stronger affinity for CO2 than typical sorbents used for point-sources have been employed for selective capture via DAC.10, 12 For instance, alkaline hydroxides13-15 or carbonates16, 17 that strongly bind to CO2 enable removal of CO2 in the form of carbonate or bicarbonate, respectively, which then can be decomposed in a subsequent step to give a pure CO2 stream for sequestration and regenerate the sorbent for additional capture of CO2. However, in addition to many of these sorbents being highly basic,10 the thermodynamic benefit of CO2 capture from ambient air comes with an energy penalty in the regeneration step, and an energy-intensive temperature swing is often needed to turn carbonate back to CO2-capture sorbents,10, 15 though there have been reports on emerging techniques to regenerate the sorbents near room temperature.18, 19 Ionic liquids have also been considered as potential sorbents for CO2 capture as they have capabilities to dissolve CO2.20 Significant advances were made through the introduction of functional groups such as amines,21, 22 but low gravimetric capacities of ionic liquids originating from their large molecular weight are challenges to overcome.23 Alternatively, amine-functionalized porous supports (e. g., zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, etc.) show promising performances in DAC, as CO2 can be chemisorbed on amine groups immobilized over large surface areas.24-26 This method is favorable as it requires less energy input for regeneration of sorbents relative to conventional amine scrubbing methods (due to the lack of water in the process), but rapid decrease of CO2-capture capacity in long-term operations is an issue to be addressed.25, 26\n",
      "In recent years, there have been various attempts to incorporate electrochemical methods in CO2 capture process.27 Notably, the electrochemical swing methods are distinct from other techniques that require thermal cycling in that they rely solely on the electronic and/or electrochemical behavior of the active materials. These methods typically function by application of voltage (and/or current) to an electrochemical cell with one or more anode-cathode pairs and subsequent CO2 capture/release through pH modulation,28 electric double layer formation,29, 39 or nucleophilicity modulation of capturing moieties.31 Electrochemically-mediated bonding has particular potential for use in DAC, since chemisorption has been proposed to be a more suitable approach than physisorption for the selective and efficient removal of CO2 under low concentrations as well as in the presence of other gases.12, 32-34\n",
      "In the current work, we focus on the latter technique, in which electrochemically tunable affinity of moieties (such as quinones) towards CO2 molecules allows cyclic capture and release of CO2. Voskian and Hatton31 recently demonstrated an effective electro-swing adsorption bed system exploiting the ability of quinones to capture CO2 under reducing conditions, and then to release this gas upon oxidation. In their system, it was necessary to directly address each of the cells in a stack individually, which can add complexity to the construction and operation of the beds. We here build upon and expand this work in both system design and operation to demonstrate a capture system with stackable bipolar cells using quinone chemistry for DAC. Specifically, we develop and construct a modular, expandable, and easy-to-fabricate cell stack with bipolar electrodes and demonstrate its applicability in DAC with feed concentrations as low as 400 ppm (0.04 %) and energy consumption as low as 113 kJ mol−1. Notably, our proposed bipolar stack design eliminates the need for external electric interconnects between adjacent cells and ensures simpler implementation. Moreover, compartments other than essential components such as electrodes, electrolyte, and gas diffusion layer could be removed from the inside of the stacked bipolar cell, leading to a substantial improvement in terms of efficient volume utilization (i. e., less space needed for the system setup).\n",
      "As shown in Figure 1, we employ the intrinsic affinity of redox-active quinone moieties towards CO2 (in liquid phase) and use their reversible complexation with CO2 molecules to demonstrate successful CO2 capture and release from the gas phase (feed stream) via quinone reduction and oxidation, respectively. Specifically, to this end, we use poly(vinylanthraquinone)-carbon nanotube (PVAQ-CNT) composite cathodes and poly(vinylferrocene)-CNT (PVFc-CNT) composite anodes. In short, upon reduction at the cathode, quinone moieties in PVAQ-CNT (which is immobilized on a conductive substrate and wetted with an ionic liquid electrolyte) undergo two-electron redox reaction and complex with dissolved CO2 molecules. The subsequent CO2 deficit in the electrolyte (liquid phase) is then replenished by diffusive transport of CO2 through the gas-liquid interface (from the gas to the liquid phase) and through the electrolyte from the interface to the quinone sites. Conversely, quinone oxidation results in decomplexation and diffusive release of CO2 from the liquid towards the gas-liquid interface and finally into the gas phase (sweep stream).\n",

The anode and cathode composites are immobilized on a conductive substrate and are wetted with a room temperature ionic liquid. Cathode reduction results in quinone complexation with dissolved CO2 and subsequent uptake of CO2 from the feed stream. Cathode oxidation, on the other hand, results in decomplexation and release of CO2.\n",
      "We use a series of these capture modules to construct a novel, easy-to-fabricate, and highly modular bipolar stack (refer to Experimental Section for more information) and develop an integrated CO2 capture/release system for DAC applications using computer-controlled valves and mass flow controllers (MFCs). We perform capture and release studies on a single-pair electrode cell (a proof-of-concept cell) as well as a meso-scale eight-pair bipolar cell, and demonstrate successful CO2 uptake at concentrations as low as 400 ppm, which enables the operation at a narrower voltage window that leads to a small energy consumption. In short, our work lays out a viable electrochemical route for DAC based on the reversible carboxylation of quinone moieties using a modular and highly customizable bipolar cell.\n",
      "Experimental Section\n",
      "Materials\n",
      "Reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and PolySciences and used without further purification. The ionic liquid electrolyte obtained from IoLiTec Inc. was 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([BMIM][TFSI]). The electrode substrate was AvCarb EP40 carbon fiber paper without polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) treatment, obtained from Fuel Cell Store.\n",
      "PVAQ synthesis\n",
      "PVAQ was synthesized via free-radical polymerization with slight modifications from a previously reported procedure.35 2-Vinylanthraquinone (2.13 mmol, 98 %) and 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (23 μmol, 98 %) were added to a three-necked flask, which was then vacuum purged with nitrogen. 1,2-Dichloroethane (21 mL, anhydrous 99.8 %) was introduced into the vessel, and the dispersion was stirred and heated under reflux at 80 °C for 21.5 h. All components dissolved in the solvent upon heating, but the solution became cloudy again by the end of the reaction. The resulting mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, after which the solid product was purified via multiple cycles of precipitation with methanol, separation by centrifugation, and re-dissolution in chloroform. The final washed polymer was dried under vacuum at room temperature with a yield of 82 %.\n",
      "Electrode preparation and characterization\n",
      "The electrodes in the flow cells used in this work were 2×2 cm2, 2.5×15 cm2, and 1×15 cm2 in size. The PVAQ-CNT and PVFc-CNT electrodes were both prepared by drop casting dispersion solutions onto the carbon paper substrates. A stock solution of 40 mg PVAQ and 120 mg multiwalled-CNT was dissolved in 20 mL N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. Similarly, a second stock solution of 80 mg PVFc and 80 mg multiwalled-CNT dissolved in 20 mL NMP was also prepared. The polymers were dispersed with the CNTs via sonication of individual stock solutions for 1 h in an ice bath to generate separate PVAQ-CNT and PVFc-CNT inks. The inks were then drop cast onto their corresponding substrates in increments of 100 μL and dried at 80 °C in a convection oven. Electrodes with various sizes and active material loadings were prepared during this work. Specifics of the size and loadings are given in the following sections accordingly. For the reference, 100 μL cm−2 PVAQ-CNT loading is equivalent to 0.85 μmol PVAQ cm−2 (or 0.8 mg cm−2 of PVAQ-CNT), and 100 μL cm−2 PVFc-CNT loading is equivalent to 1.87 μmol PVFc cm−2 (or 0.8 mg cm−2 of PVFc-CNT).\n",
      "Further, electrochemical characterization (cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) and charge/discharge cycles (chronoamperometry and chronopotentiometry) were performed, respectively, on a PARSTAT 4000A potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research) and a Keithley 2440 sourcemeter (Keithley Instruments). Three-electrode characterizations were performed in a BASi cell with Pt wire and Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Experiments were performed with [BMIM][TFSI] electrolyte under both N2 and CO2 (saturated) conditions.\n",
      "Stackable bipolar cell design\n",
      "The bipolar cell, as shown in Figure 2, uses multiple capture modules with in-series electrical connections. Each module consists of a PVFc-CNT positive electrode, a separator, a PVAQ-CNT negative electrode, and a porous electrically conductive medium (such as titanium foam) serving as an air conduit. Specifically, as depicted in Figure 2a, each module was composed of (1) a pair of 185 μm thick PVAQ-CNT and PVFc-CNT electrodes, (2) a 50 μm thick polypropylene separator (Celgard), (3) a 1 mm thick nickel foam with 60 ppi pore size acting as air conduit, and (4) titanium sheets acting as current collectors. The modules were stacked face to face as in Figure 2b, resulting in a series of capture modules in which the opposite electrodes of adjacent modules are electrically – but not ionically – connected via the air conduit (hence the name bipolar stack), while opposite electrodes in the same module are ionically – but not electronically – connected by the separator. The assembly was then sandwiched between two acrylic endplates and sealed with silicone rubber gaskets and fasteners (McMaster-Carr). We henceforth call this assembly the stackable bipolar cell (or simply, the cell). The design described here, which to some extent is reminiscent of the fuel cell structure, eliminates the need for external electric interconnects between the adjacent modules and ensures simpler implementation while greatly increasing the modularity. The external voltage is simply equally split between electrode pairs, driving the quinone redox reactions and subsequent capture and release of CO2.\n",

(c) Simplified three-dimensional (3D) drawing and (d) photograph of the cell. Modules consist of anode, cathode, separator, and porous conductive air conduit. The stacking provides electrical contact between opposite electrodes of adjacent modules (via the conductive air conduit) and ionic connection between opposite electrodes in the same module (via the separator). By design, the external voltage is then simply equally split between the electrode pairs, driving similar capture dynamics in each module. (e) Schematic diagram of our continuous CO2 capture and release system with MFCs, three-way valves, power source, CO2 sensor, and our electrochemical cell.

      "Carbon capture and release platform\n",
      "The capture and release platform, as shown in the schematic of Figure 2e, was composed of N2 and 5 % CO2 (in nitrogen) feed gas lines (Airgas), three MFCs (Cole-Parmer), computer-controlled three-way valves, a power source, a flow-through CO2 sensor (ExplorIR-W 5 %), and our bipolar cell. We note that the gas mixture of N2 and CO2 was used here for the cell operation due to the oxygen sensitivity of quinones. These experiments were designed specifically to demonstrate the operational behavior of the quinone-based electrochemical CO2 capture system in a stackable bipolar cell configuration, which would let us draw connection between the current finding and practical application (which uses the air as the feed stream) once the oxygen-sensitivity challenge is resolved. The two feed streams were mixed at 125 : 1 ratio to generate a 400 ppm (0.04 %) CO2 stream in N2 carrier gas with total flowrate of 600 mL min−1. This corresponds to flowrates of roughly 4.8 and 595.2 mL min−1, respectively, which are comfortably within the operating range of each MFC. The resulting 400 ppm CO2 stream was then passed through a third MFC, reducing the flowrate to 5 mL min−1 by venting the excess flow directly to the atmosphere; the use of only two MFCs (instead of three), resulted in an exceedingly slow and hard to achieve flowrate for the 5 % CO2 stream. The final 400 ppm feed stream was then passed through the bipolar cell, and, subsequently, the flow-through CO2 detector. The two computer-controlled valves immediately upstream and downstream of the cell stack were used to allow or block the feed through the cell on demand. A power source (Keithley 2440) was used for application of voltage/current to the cell, and a single-channel digital multimeter (Fluke) in conjunction with a custom-built 8-channel relay pack was used to monitor the voltage level of individual modules during the operation of the cell. All components of the setup (MFCs, valves, power source, relays, voltage meter, and CO2 sensor) were connected to and controlled by a computer.\n",
      "Results and Discussion\n",
      "Electrochemically mediated CO2 separation\n",
      "Quinone moieties, and thus PVAQ polymers, undergo two-electron charge transfer upon oxidation and reduction in aprotic electrolytes and can reversibly complex with electrophiles such as CO2 (but not N2) during the process.31, 36, 37 This reversible carboxylation of PVAQ-CNT electrodes results in great selectivity towards CO2, and, once paired with counter electrodes such as PVFc-CNT to balance the charge, can be a viable solution for carbon capture applications. Further, the electrolyte can play a significant role in the operation of the cell. Specifically, due to flow of gas over the wetted electrodes, electrolyte evaporation can be a major concern. Aqueous electrolytes require frequent electrolyte replenishment, and, moreover, tend to dissolve quinones, resulting in quick capacity fade. Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), however, have negligible vapor pressure with minimal evaporation and eliminate the need for electrolyte replenishment. In this work, [BMIM][TFSI] electrolyte is used due to its low vapor pressure and good CO2 solubility (around 4 g L−1).38\n",
      "Figure 3 shows cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of individual electrodes in a three-electrode setup (BASi) with Pt wire counter electrode and a leakless Ag/AgCl reference (eDAQ) in [BMIM][TFSI] electrolyte at a slow scan rate of 5 mV s−1. As evident from the CV curve, the PVAQ-CNT cathode in CO2-deprived electrolyte (under N2 atmosphere) has two distinct reduction peaks corresponding to two-step activation of quinone centers in the absence of CO2. In a CO2-rich environment, on the other hand, the two peaks merge into a single peak close to the first reduction potential, which is a direct indication of reversible complexation of quinone centers with dissolved CO2, with a redox potential of around −0.7 V (measured as the average of reduction and oxidation potentials). Together with the PVFc-CNT electrode, the electrochemical voltage window (measured as the distance between average redox potential of PVAQ-CNT and PVFc-CNT electrodes) is approximately 1.1 V. As a result, in a cell with a PVFc-CNT anode and a PVAQ-CNT cathode, one can expect complete activation of both quinone and ferrocene moieties theoretically at voltages above 1.1 V, although a larger voltage window would be needed to overcome the kinetic barriers.\n",

Notably, PVAQ-CNT shows two distinct quinone redox peaks in the absence of CO2 (under N2), while the two peaks merge in a CO2-rich environment. In the cathodic scan, the second reduction peak (located at a more negative potential) undergoes positive potential shift by the complexation between quinone and dissolved CO2; formation of carbonate at one of the carbonyl groups makes the quinone aromatic ring relatively neutral, leading to a facilitated reduction of second carbonyl group that leads to nucleophilic addition of another CO2 [forming quinone bis(carbonate)]. In the anodic scan, one peak appears under CO2 at a relatively positive potential compared to those observed under N2. This is attributable to the larger driving force required for oxidation of quinone bis(carbonate) than that needed for quinone dianion oxidation.37\n",
      "Capture and release cycles: proof of concept\n",
      "Before study of a multi-pair electrode cell, in this section, we demonstrate capture and release cycles in a small-scale cell with a single electrode pair. The cell had a bed volume – the empty space within the cell through which the gas flow and contact occurs – of 1.5 mL with 2×2 cm2 electrodes, and the feed stream was 400 ppm CO2 in N2 carrier gas. The electrode loadings were 0.3 μmol cm−2 PVAQ-CNT and 0.6 μmol cm−2 PVFc-CNT. In the following, we first demonstrate the capture and release of atmospheric-level CO2 (400 ppm) in a three-step cycle (capture, release at no-flow, and flush) and later show continuous cyclic operation of the cell under quasi-steady-state condition.\n",
      "Figure 4a shows effluent CO2 concentration vs number of bed volumes (i. e., total volume gas introduced to the cell relative to the actual bed volume available for flow) for the cell operated in a capture-release-flush sequence. Prior to start of the experiment, a constant flow of N2 at 5 mL min−1 was fed to the cell for 1 h. The feed gas was then immediately switched to 400 ppm CO2 (at\n",
      ") and a voltage of 1.5 V was applied across the cell. The capture-release-flush sequence is as follows: (1) capture step upon application of 1.5 V to the cell and under 5 mL min−1 flowrate, (2) release step at 0 V cell voltage and stopped flow, and finally (3) flush step under the flow of 400 ppm CO2 with 5 mL min−1 flowrate at the same cell voltage (0 V). A separate control experiment under the same conditions but at 0 V throughout was also performed. The control is used to reveal the mixing and gas dispersion effects in the cell in the absence of electrochemical CO2 uptake. As evident from Figure 4a, the breakthrough curve for the control experiment shows an initial region with zero effluent CO2 concentration, followed by a sharp increase in the concentration. The two regions correspond respectively to (1) the delay due to gas detector position and (2) convective transport and dispersion of the gas inside the cell. The capture/release experiment shows a similar breakthrough profile, but with two important differences: complete CO2 removal up to 10 bed volumes, and slower effluent concentration recovery compared to the control experiment. The latter is partly due to dispersion of gas and partly to electrochemical adsorption of CO2 into the cell. The area between the two breakthrough curves is indicative of the amount of CO2 captured, which is approximately equal to the released amount during the flush step, as expected.\n",

(c) Captured and release amounts of CO2 as well as Coulombic efficiency during each cycle.\n",
      "Figure 4b shows cyclic operation of a fresh cell for six complete cycles at 1.5 and 0 V during the capture and release steps, respectively, each for a duration of around 800 s (45 bed volumes). The results show successful capture and release of CO2 at the low concentration of 400 ppm, even in presence of N2 gas in 2500-fold abundance. The cell achieves near-complete removal of CO2 in the first cycle but only partial release at 0 V, with the captured amount being significantly larger than the released amount (refer to Figure 4c). While these effects are partially due to mass transfer limitations within the electrolyte and across the gas-liquid interface, and have been attributed to a tradeoff between capacity and throughput of the system in other flow studies,39, 40 the primary reason is the physical solubility of CO2 in the electrolyte in equilibrium with the sweep stream; when the electrodes are reactivated for adsorption, this residual CO2 immediately complexes with the quinones, reducing their availability for capture of CO2 from the fresh feed stream. A simple modeling analysis of these issues is given in a later section, where it is shown that the capacity is directly impacted by the amount of CO2 captured by the activated quinones relative to that physically dissolved in the electrolyte. After a number of cycles, the cell reaches dynamic steady state in which subsequent cycles become progressively similar, as is evident from Figure 4c, where CO2 uptake and released amounts converge. The amounts (in moles) are calculated by integrating the area bounded by the CO2 concentration profile and 400 ppm line (inlet concentration) using the relation below:\n",

Lastly, Figure 4c also shows the Coulombic efficiency of up to around 92 % (defined as charge transferred during charging over that during discharging), suggesting effective direct air capture using quinone chemistry and the fabricated cell.

Release and flush steps were performed under no-flow and 5 mL min−1 flowrate conditions, respectively. Results in Figure 5a, as expected, show equal voltage split across the three modules, with positive current during capture and negative current during subsequent release steps, confirming the effectiveness of our bipolar stack design.

Voltage windows much wider than 1.3 V are not favorable, as they increase the energy consumption without appreciable increase in the system throughput. Additionally, as shown by Voskian and Hatton,31 lower energetics can be attained with working capacities (i. e., released amount vs maximum capacity) of about 50 %–60 %, corresponding here to a cell voltage of about 0.8 V.\n",
      "Capture and release with bipolar stack\n",
      "In this section, we discuss direct air capture (and release) and the associated energy consumption via the meso-scale eight-pair cell discussed in the Experimental Section. The cell had about 14 mL bed volume with 1×15 cm2 electrodes with loadings of 0.5 μmol cm−2 (PVFc-CNT) and 0.25 μmol cm−2 (PVAQ-CNT), operating at a 5 mL min−1 flowrate. Importantly, inspired by the observations made in the previous section and in an attempt to minimize the overall energy consumption, we limit the operating voltage window of each module to between 1.2 V (for capture) to 0.6 V (for release) and thus operate the cell in 4.8 to 9.6 V range. Additionally, each capture and release cycle consisted of an initial constant current step (±0.5 mA) followed by operation for a period with constant voltage across the cell. The current is limited to prevent excessive resistive (Coulombic) loss during the voltage switch. Figures 6a and b show voltages of individual modules, total current, and the effluent CO2 concentration for seven consecutive cycles. Results show roughly similar voltage profiles for the eight modules (0.6 to 1.2 V) in the bipolar stack. The narrower flow channel (compared to 2.5×15 cm2 in the previous section) enabled a more efficient capture of CO2 as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Additionally, similar to Figure 4b, the effluent concentration profile reaches a dynamic steady state, resulting in stable capture and release after 6–7 cycles.\n",

The values here are calculated as the sum of electrical and pneumatic work over the course of a single cycle; we note, however, that the pressure drop across the cell at 5 mL min−1 flowrate is on the order of tens of Pa, resulting in negligible pneumatic energy consumption. The trend in Figure 6c clearly shows a tradeoff between capture rate and energy efficiency: the first cycle demonstrates highest capture amount (and highest capture rate) at the expense of lowest energy efficiency (≈900 kJ mol−1), while subsequent cycles with lower capture amount require progressively less energy down to only around 100 kJ mol−1. This level of energy consumption matches that in the state-of-the-art DAC systems, with reported values in the range of 100–150 kJ mol−1. That said, we note that the interplay of the two metrics together, and not just the energy consumption, defines the figures of merit relevant to practical DAC operation and plant design. We note below that the physical solubility of the CO2 in the electrolyte plays an important role in dictating the overall performance of the system for any given quinone loading.\n",

      "Connecting for saving energy consumption: Poly(vinylanthraquinone)-based system for electrochemically-mediated direct air capture of CO2 is herein developed and investigated. Operation of the cell is systematically explored under various configurations, based on which a stackable bipolar cell with nearly equal distribution of applied voltages throughout eight pairs of electrodes is demonstrated, leading to the energy consumption as low as 113 kJ/mol at atmospheric level of CO2.\n",
      "Abstract\n",
      "The unprecedented increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration calls for effective carbon capture technologies. With distributed sources contributing to about half of the overall emission, CO2 capture from the atmosphere [direct air capture, (DAC)] is more relevant than ever. Herein, an electrochemically mediated DAC system is reported which utilizes affinity of redox-active quinone moieties towards CO2 molecules, and unlike incumbent chemisorption technologies which require temperature or pH swing, relies solely on the electrochemical voltage for CO2 capture and release. The design and operation of a DAC system is demonstrated with stackable bipolar cells using quinone chemistry. Specifically, poly(vinylanthraquinone) (PVAQ) negative electrode undergoes a two-electron reduction reaction and reversibly complexes with CO2, leading to CO2 sequestration from the feed stream. The subsequent PVAQ oxidation, conversely, results in release of CO2. The performance of both small- and meso-scale cells for DAC are evaluated with feed CO2 concentrations as low as 400 ppm (0.04 %), and energy consumption is demonstrated as low as 113 kJ per mole of CO2 captured. Notably, the bipolar cell construct is modular and expandable, equally suitable for small and large plants. Moving forward, this work presents a viable and highly customizable electrochemical method for DAC.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "The unprecedented increase in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gasses (specifically CO2) with its direct effect on global climate patterns is of major concern for the 21st century. Atmospheric CO2 levels which remained constant at around 280 ppm in the preindustrial era, have grown over recent decades to exceed 400 ppm, and the trajectory of ever-increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions suggests that the CO2 level could be nearly doubled within this century.1, 2 The upper boundary of CO2 concentration to avoid catastrophic climate and environmental changes was estimated to be around 500 ppm by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,3 and we are approaching this limit at an alarming rate. Therefore, a multitude of technologies have been developed in an effort to mitigate CO2 emissions: from solvent scrubbing4 and oxy-fuel combustion5 to thermal6, 7 or electrochemical methods8, 9 for CO2 capture from the point sources (such as power plants) that are mostly responsible for the rise of atmospheric CO2 concentration.\n",
      "A significant contribution (roughly half) to overall CO2 emissions can be attributed to distributed sources, and thus removal of existing CO2 from air (often noted as direct air capture, or DAC) is also essential for ensuring the CO2 levels do not go beyond the targeted range.10 DAC is a potential solution for climate change mitigation, with a number of technologies moving towards commercialization. While the applicability of DAC still requires validation, recent techno-economic assessments suggest reduction in CO2 capture costs when implemented on a large-scale.11 As the CO2 concentration in ambient air is extremely dilute, chemisorbents with stronger affinity for CO2 than typical sorbents used for point-sources have been employed for selective capture via DAC.10, 12 For instance, alkaline hydroxides13-15 or carbonates16, 17 that strongly bind to CO2 enable removal of CO2 in the form of carbonate or bicarbonate, respectively, which then can be decomposed in a subsequent step to give a pure CO2 stream for sequestration and regenerate the sorbent for additional capture of CO2. However, in addition to many of these sorbents being highly basic,10 the thermodynamic benefit of CO2 capture from ambient air comes with an energy penalty in the regeneration step, and an energy-intensive temperature swing is often needed to turn carbonate back to CO2-capture sorbents,10, 15 though there have been reports on emerging techniques to regenerate the sorbents near room temperature.18, 19 Ionic liquids have also been considered as potential sorbents for CO2 capture as they have capabilities to dissolve CO2.20 Significant advances were made through the introduction of functional groups such as amines,21, 22 but low gravimetric capacities of ionic liquids originating from their large molecular weight are challenges to overcome.23 Alternatively, amine-functionalized porous supports (e. g., zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, etc.) show promising performances in DAC, as CO2 can be chemisorbed on amine groups immobilized over large surface areas.24-26 This method is favorable as it requires less energy input for regeneration of sorbents relative to conventional amine scrubbing methods (due to the lack of water in the process), but rapid decrease of CO2-capture capacity in long-term operations is an issue to be addressed.25, 26\n",
      "In recent years, there have been various attempts to incorporate electrochemical methods in CO2 capture process.27 Notably, the electrochemical swing methods are distinct from other techniques that require thermal cycling in that they rely solely on the electronic and/or electrochemical behavior of the active materials. These methods typically function by application of voltage (and/or current) to an electrochemical cell with one or more anode-cathode pairs and subsequent CO2 capture/release through pH modulation,28 electric double layer formation,29, 39 or nucleophilicity modulation of capturing moieties.31 Electrochemically-mediated bonding has particular potential for use in DAC, since chemisorption has been proposed to be a more suitable approach than physisorption for the selective and efficient removal of CO2 under low concentrations as well as in the presence of other gases.12, 32-34\n",
      "In the current work, we focus on the latter technique, in which electrochemically tunable affinity of moieties (such as quinones) towards CO2 molecules allows cyclic capture and release of CO2. Voskian and Hatton31 recently demonstrated an effective electro-swing adsorption bed system exploiting the ability of quinones to capture CO2 under reducing conditions, and then to release this gas upon oxidation. In their system, it was necessary to directly address each of the cells in a stack individually, which can add complexity to the construction and operation of the beds. We here build upon and expand this work in both system design and operation to demonstrate a capture system with stackable bipolar cells using quinone chemistry for DAC. Specifically, we develop and construct a modular, expandable, and easy-to-fabricate cell stack with bipolar electrodes and demonstrate its applicability in DAC with feed concentrations as low as 400 ppm (0.04 %) and energy consumption as low as 113 kJ mol−1. Notably, our proposed bipolar stack design eliminates the need for external electric interconnects between adjacent cells and ensures simpler implementation. Moreover, compartments other than essential components such as electrodes, electrolyte, and gas diffusion layer could be removed from the inside of the stacked bipolar cell, leading to a substantial improvement in terms of efficient volume utilization (i. e., less space needed for the system setup).\n",
      "As shown in Figure 1, we employ the intrinsic affinity of redox-active quinone moieties towards CO2 (in liquid phase) and use their reversible complexation with CO2 molecules to demonstrate successful CO2 capture and release from the gas phase (feed stream) via quinone reduction and oxidation, respectively. Specifically, to this end, we use poly(vinylanthraquinone)-carbon nanotube (PVAQ-CNT) composite cathodes and poly(vinylferrocene)-CNT (PVFc-CNT) composite anodes. In short, upon reduction at the cathode, quinone moieties in PVAQ-CNT (which is immobilized on a conductive substrate and wetted with an ionic liquid electrolyte) undergo two-electron redox reaction and complex with dissolved CO2 molecules. The subsequent CO2 deficit in the electrolyte (liquid phase) is then replenished by diffusive transport of CO2 through the gas-liquid interface (from the gas to the liquid phase) and through the electrolyte from the interface to the quinone sites. Conversely, quinone oxidation results in decomplexation and diffusive release of CO2 from the liquid towards the gas-liquid interface and finally into the gas phase (sweep stream).\n",

The anode and cathode composites are immobilized on a conductive substrate and are wetted with a room temperature ionic liquid.

Cathode oxidation, on the other hand, results in decomplexation and release of CO2.\n",
      "We use a series of these capture modules to construct a novel, easy-to-fabricate, and highly modular bipolar stack (refer to Experimental Section for more information) and develop an integrated CO2 capture/release system for DAC applications using computer-controlled valves and mass flow controllers (MFCs). We perform capture and release studies on a single-pair electrode cell (a proof-of-concept cell) as well as a meso-scale eight-pair bipolar cell, and demonstrate successful CO2 uptake at concentrations as low as 400 ppm, which enables the operation at a narrower voltage window that leads to a small energy consumption. In short, our work lays out a viable electrochemical route for DAC based on the reversible carboxylation of quinone moieties using a modular and highly customizable bipolar cell.\n",

      "Reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and PolySciences and used without further purification. The ionic liquid electrolyte obtained from IoLiTec Inc. was 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([BMIM][TFSI]). The electrode substrate was AvCarb EP40 carbon fiber paper without polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) treatment, obtained from Fuel Cell Store.\n",
      "PVAQ synthesis\n",
      "PVAQ was synthesized via free-radical polymerization with slight modifications from a previously reported procedure.35 2-Vinylanthraquinone (2.13 mmol, 98 %) and 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (23 μmol, 98 %) were added to a three-necked flask, which was then vacuum purged with nitrogen. 1,2-Dichloroethane (21 mL, anhydrous 99.8 %) was introduced into the vessel, and the dispersion was stirred and heated under reflux at 80 °C for 21.5 h. All components dissolved in the solvent upon heating, but the solution became cloudy again by the end of the reaction. The resulting mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, after which the solid product was purified via multiple cycles of precipitation with methanol, separation by centrifugation, and re-dissolution in chloroform. The final washed polymer was dried under vacuum at room temperature with a yield of 82 %.\n",
      "Electrode preparation and characterization\n",
      "The electrodes in the flow cells used in this work were 2×2 cm2, 2.5×15 cm2, and 1×15 cm2 in size. The PVAQ-CNT and PVFc-CNT electrodes were both prepared by drop casting dispersion solutions onto the carbon paper substrates. A stock solution of 40 mg PVAQ and 120 mg multiwalled-CNT was dissolved in 20 mL N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) solvent. Similarly, a second stock solution of 80 mg PVFc and 80 mg multiwalled-CNT dissolved in 20 mL NMP was also prepared. The polymers were dispersed with the CNTs via sonication of individual stock solutions for 1 h in an ice bath to generate separate PVAQ-CNT and PVFc-CNT inks. The inks were then drop cast onto their corresponding substrates in increments of 100 μL and dried at 80 °C in a convection oven. Electrodes with various sizes and active material loadings were prepared during this work. Specifics of the size and loadings are given in the following sections accordingly. For the reference, 100 μL cm−2 PVAQ-CNT loading is equivalent to 0.85 μmol PVAQ cm−2 (or 0.8 mg cm−2 of PVAQ-CNT), and 100 μL cm−2 PVFc-CNT loading is equivalent to 1.87 μmol PVFc cm−2 (or 0.8 mg cm−2 of PVFc-CNT).\n",
      "Further, electrochemical characterization (cyclic voltammetry, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) and charge/discharge cycles (chronoamperometry and chronopotentiometry) were performed, respectively, on a PARSTAT 4000A potentiostat (Princeton Applied Research) and a Keithley 2440 sourcemeter (Keithley Instruments). Three-electrode characterizations were performed in a BASi cell with Pt wire and Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Experiments were performed with [BMIM][TFSI] electrolyte under both N2 and CO2 (saturated) conditions.\n",
      "Stackable bipolar cell design\n",
      "The bipolar cell, as shown in Figure 2, uses multiple capture modules with in-series electrical connections. Each module consists of a PVFc-CNT positive electrode, a separator, a PVAQ-CNT negative electrode, and a porous electrically conductive medium (such as titanium foam) serving as an air conduit. Specifically, as depicted in Figure 2a, each module was composed of (1) a pair of 185 μm thick PVAQ-CNT and PVFc-CNT electrodes, (2) a 50 μm thick polypropylene separator (Celgard), (3) a 1 mm thick nickel foam with 60 ppi pore size acting as air conduit, and (4) titanium sheets acting as current collectors. The modules were stacked face to face as in Figure 2b, resulting in a series of capture modules in which the opposite electrodes of adjacent modules are electrically – but not ionically – connected via the air conduit (hence the name bipolar stack), while opposite electrodes in the same module are ionically – but not electronically – connected by the separator. The assembly was then sandwiched between two acrylic endplates and sealed with silicone rubber gaskets and fasteners (McMaster-Carr). We henceforth call this assembly the stackable bipolar cell (or simply, the cell). The design described here, which to some extent is reminiscent of the fuel cell structure, eliminates the need for external electric interconnects between the adjacent modules and ensures simpler implementation while greatly increasing the modularity. The external voltage is simply equally split between electrode pairs, driving the quinone redox reactions and subsequent capture and release of CO2.\n",

The stacking provides electrical contact between opposite electrodes of adjacent modules (via the conductive air conduit) and ionic connection between opposite electrodes in the same module (via the separator). By design, the external voltage is then simply equally split between the electrode pairs, driving similar capture dynamics in each module. (e) Schematic diagram of our continuous CO2 capture and release system with MFCs, three-way valves, power source, CO2 sensor, and our electrochemical cell.

      "Carbon capture and release platform\n",
      "The capture and release platform, as shown in the schematic of Figure 2e, was composed of N2 and 5 % CO2 (in nitrogen) feed gas lines (Airgas), three MFCs (Cole-Parmer), computer-controlled three-way valves, a power source, a flow-through CO2 sensor (ExplorIR-W 5 %), and our bipolar cell. We note that the gas mixture of N2 and CO2 was used here for the cell operation due to the oxygen sensitivity of quinones. These experiments were designed specifically to demonstrate the operational behavior of the quinone-based electrochemical CO2 capture system in a stackable bipolar cell configuration, which would let us draw connection between the current finding and practical application (which uses the air as the feed stream) once the oxygen-sensitivity challenge is resolved. The two feed streams were mixed at 125 : 1 ratio to generate a 400 ppm (0.04 %) CO2 stream in N2 carrier gas with total flowrate of 600 mL min−1. This corresponds to flowrates of roughly 4.8 and 595.2 mL min−1, respectively, which are comfortably within the operating range of each MFC. The resulting 400 ppm CO2 stream was then passed through a third MFC, reducing the flowrate to 5 mL min−1 by venting the excess flow directly to the atmosphere; the use of only two MFCs (instead of three), resulted in an exceedingly slow and hard to achieve flowrate for the 5 % CO2 stream. The final 400 ppm feed stream was then passed through the bipolar cell, and, subsequently, the flow-through CO2 detector. The two computer-controlled valves immediately upstream and downstream of the cell stack were used to allow or block the feed through the cell on demand. A power source (Keithley 2440) was used for application of voltage/current to the cell, and a single-channel digital multimeter (Fluke) in conjunction with a custom-built 8-channel relay pack was used to monitor the voltage level of individual modules during the operation of the cell. All components of the setup (MFCs, valves, power source, relays, voltage meter, and CO2 sensor) were connected to and controlled by a computer.\n",
      "Results and Discussion\n",
      "Electrochemically mediated CO2 separation\n",
      "Quinone moieties, and thus PVAQ polymers, undergo two-electron charge transfer upon oxidation and reduction in aprotic electrolytes and can reversibly complex with electrophiles such as CO2 (but not N2) during the process.31, 36, 37 This reversible carboxylation of PVAQ-CNT electrodes results in great selectivity towards CO2, and, once paired with counter electrodes such as PVFc-CNT to balance the charge, can be a viable solution for carbon capture applications. Further, the electrolyte can play a significant role in the operation of the cell. Specifically, due to flow of gas over the wetted electrodes, electrolyte evaporation can be a major concern. Aqueous electrolytes require frequent electrolyte replenishment, and, moreover, tend to dissolve quinones, resulting in quick capacity fade. Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), however, have negligible vapor pressure with minimal evaporation and eliminate the need for electrolyte replenishment. In this work, [BMIM][TFSI] electrolyte is used due to its low vapor pressure and good CO2 solubility (around 4 g L−1).38\n",
      "Figure 3 shows cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of individual electrodes in a three-electrode setup (BASi) with Pt wire counter electrode and a leakless Ag/AgCl reference (eDAQ) in [BMIM][TFSI] electrolyte at a slow scan rate of 5 mV s−1. As evident from the CV curve, the PVAQ-CNT cathode in CO2-deprived electrolyte (under N2 atmosphere) has two distinct reduction peaks corresponding to two-step activation of quinone centers in the absence of CO2. In a CO2-rich environment, on the other hand, the two peaks merge into a single peak close to the first reduction potential, which is a direct indication of reversible complexation of quinone centers with dissolved CO2, with a redox potential of around −0.7 V (measured as the average of reduction and oxidation potentials). Together with the PVFc-CNT electrode, the electrochemical voltage window (measured as the distance between average redox potential of PVAQ-CNT and PVFc-CNT electrodes) is approximately 1.1 V. As a result, in a cell with a PVFc-CNT anode and a PVAQ-CNT cathode, one can expect complete activation of both quinone and ferrocene moieties theoretically at voltages above 1.1 V, although a larger voltage window would be needed to overcome the kinetic barriers.\n",

Notably, PVAQ-CNT shows two distinct quinone redox peaks in the absence of CO2 (under N2), while the two peaks merge in a CO2-rich environment. In the cathodic scan, the second reduction peak (located at a more negative potential) undergoes positive potential shift by the complexation between quinone and dissolved CO2; formation of carbonate at one of the carbonyl groups makes the quinone aromatic ring relatively neutral, leading to a facilitated reduction of second carbonyl group that leads to nucleophilic addition of another CO2 [forming quinone bis(carbonate)]. In the anodic scan, one peak appears under CO2 at a relatively positive potential compared to those observed under N2. This is attributable to the larger driving force required for oxidation of quinone bis(carbonate) than that needed for quinone dianion oxidation.37\n",
      "Capture and release cycles: proof of concept\n",
      "Before study of a multi-pair electrode cell, in this section, we demonstrate capture and release cycles in a small-scale cell with a single electrode pair. The cell had a bed volume – the empty space within the cell through which the gas flow and contact occurs – of 1.5 mL with 2×2 cm2 electrodes, and the feed stream was 400 ppm CO2 in N2 carrier gas. The electrode loadings were 0.3 μmol cm−2 PVAQ-CNT and 0.6 μmol cm−2 PVFc-CNT. In the following, we first demonstrate the capture and release of atmospheric-level CO2 (400 ppm) in a three-step cycle (capture, release at no-flow, and flush) and later show continuous cyclic operation of the cell under quasi-steady-state condition.\n",
      "Figure 4a shows effluent CO2 concentration vs number of bed volumes (i. e., total volume gas introduced to the cell relative to the actual bed volume available for flow) for the cell operated in a capture-release-flush sequence. Prior to start of the experiment, a constant flow of N2 at 5 mL min−1 was fed to the cell for 1 h. The feed gas was then immediately switched to 400 ppm CO2 (at\n",
      ") and a voltage of 1.5 V was applied across the cell. The capture-release-flush sequence is as follows: (1) capture step upon application of 1.5 V to the cell and under 5 mL min−1 flowrate, (2) release step at 0 V cell voltage and stopped flow, and finally (3) flush step under the flow of 400 ppm CO2 with 5 mL min−1 flowrate at the same cell voltage (0 V). A separate control experiment under the same conditions but at 0 V throughout was also performed. The control is used to reveal the mixing and gas dispersion effects in the cell in the absence of electrochemical CO2 uptake. As evident from Figure 4a, the breakthrough curve for the control experiment shows an initial region with zero effluent CO2 concentration, followed by a sharp increase in the concentration. The two regions correspond respectively to (1) the delay due to gas detector position and (2) convective transport and dispersion of the gas inside the cell. The capture/release experiment shows a similar breakthrough profile, but with two important differences: complete CO2 removal up to 10 bed volumes, and slower effluent concentration recovery compared to the control experiment. The latter is partly due to dispersion of gas and partly to electrochemical adsorption of CO2 into the cell. The area between the two breakthrough curves is indicative of the amount of CO2 captured, which is approximately equal to the released amount during the flush step, as expected.\n",

(b) Cyclic operation of a fresh cell with 1.5 and 0 V during capture and release steps, respectively. Dynamic steady state is achieved after six cycles. (c) Captured and release amounts of CO2 as well as Coulombic efficiency during each cycle.\n",
      "Figure 4b shows cyclic operation of a fresh cell for six complete cycles at 1.5 and 0 V during the capture and release steps, respectively, each for a duration of around 800 s (45 bed volumes). The results show successful capture and release of CO2 at the low concentration of 400 ppm, even in presence of N2 gas in 2500-fold abundance. The cell achieves near-complete removal of CO2 in the first cycle but only partial release at 0 V, with the captured amount being significantly larger than the released amount (refer to Figure 4c). While these effects are partially due to mass transfer limitations within the electrolyte and across the gas-liquid interface, and have been attributed to a tradeoff between capacity and throughput of the system in other flow studies,39, 40 the primary reason is the physical solubility of CO2 in the electrolyte in equilibrium with the sweep stream; when the electrodes are reactivated for adsorption, this residual CO2 immediately complexes with the quinones, reducing their availability for capture of CO2 from the fresh feed stream. A simple modeling analysis of these issues is given in a later section, where it is shown that the capacity is directly impacted by the amount of CO2 captured by the activated quinones relative to that physically dissolved in the electrolyte. After a number of cycles, the cell reaches dynamic steady state in which subsequent cycles become progressively similar, as is evident from Figure 4c, where CO2 uptake and released amounts converge. The amounts (in moles) are calculated by integrating the area bounded by the CO2 concentration profile and 400 ppm line (inlet concentration) using the relation below:\n",

Lastly, Figure 4c also shows the Coulombic efficiency of up to around 92 % (defined as charge transferred during charging over that during discharging), suggesting effective direct air capture using quinone chemistry and the fabricated cell. The low efficiency in the first cycle is because a part of the CO2 released by the quinones remains physically in the electrolyte solution and does not transport to the sweep stream.\n",
      "Voltage distribution and capture dynamics\n",
      "We here discuss the effectiveness of the bipolar stack in splitting the voltage equally across multiple electrode pairs and the associated mass transport limitations. Figure 5a and b show an example of cell and module voltages, current, and effluent concentration profiles for a bipolar cell with three electrode pairs (denoted as modules 1 to 3) with 400 ppm influent CO2 and 5 mL min−1 flowrate. The cell had active material loading density similar to that in the previous section, but with larger electrodes (2.5×15 cm) and bed volume (12 mL). The experiment consisted of a capture step at 3.6 V (1.2 V across each module) for a duration of 2 h, followed by a series of release and flush steps at 3, 2.4, 1.8, 1.2, 0.6, and 0 V levels. Release and flush steps were performed under no-flow and 5 mL min−1 flowrate conditions, respectively. Results in Figure 5a, as expected, show equal voltage split across the three modules, with positive current during capture and negative current during subsequent release steps, confirming the effectiveness of our bipolar stack design. The results in Figure 5b show almost complete CO2 removal during the capture step and step-wise release during the subsequent flush steps.\n",

Voltage windows much wider than 1.3 V are not favorable, as they increase the energy consumption without appreciable increase in the system throughput. Additionally, as shown by Voskian and Hatton,31 lower energetics can be attained with working capacities (i. e., released amount vs maximum capacity) of about 50 %–60 %, corresponding here to a cell voltage of about 0.8 V.\n",
      "Capture and release with bipolar stack\n",
      "In this section, we discuss direct air capture (and release) and the associated energy consumption via the meso-scale eight-pair cell discussed in the Experimental Section. The cell had about 14 mL bed volume with 1×15 cm2 electrodes with loadings of 0.5 μmol cm−2 (PVFc-CNT) and 0.25 μmol cm−2 (PVAQ-CNT), operating at a 5 mL min−1 flowrate. Importantly, inspired by the observations made in the previous section and in an attempt to minimize the overall energy consumption, we limit the operating voltage window of each module to between 1.2 V (for capture) to 0.6 V (for release) and thus operate the cell in 4.8 to 9.6 V range. Additionally, each capture and release cycle consisted of an initial constant current step (±0.5 mA) followed by operation for a period with constant voltage across the cell. The current is limited to prevent excessive resistive (Coulombic) loss during the voltage switch. Figures 6a and b show voltages of individual modules, total current, and the effluent CO2 concentration for seven consecutive cycles. Results show roughly similar voltage profiles for the eight modules (0.6 to 1.2 V) in the bipolar stack. The narrower flow channel (compared to 2.5×15 cm2 in the previous section) enabled a more efficient capture of CO2 as shown in Figure S1 (Supporting Information). Additionally, similar to Figure 4b, the effluent concentration profile reaches a dynamic steady state, resulting in stable capture and release after 6–7 cycles.\n",

Results show a clear tradeoff between capture rate and energy efficiency.\n",
      "The corresponding specific energy consumption (kJ mol−1 CO2) shown in Figure 6c continuously decreases: from 900 kJ mol−1 in the first cycle down to around 100 kJ mol−1 during the steady state operation of the cell. The values here are calculated as the sum of electrical and pneumatic work over the course of a single cycle; we note, however, that the pressure drop across the cell at 5 mL min−1 flowrate is on the order of tens of Pa, resulting in negligible pneumatic energy consumption. The trend in Figure 6c clearly shows a tradeoff between capture rate and energy efficiency: the first cycle demonstrates highest capture amount (and highest capture rate) at the expense of lowest energy efficiency (≈900 kJ mol−1), while subsequent cycles with lower capture amount require progressively less energy down to only around 100 kJ mol−1. This level of energy consumption matches that in the state-of-the-art DAC systems, with reported values in the range of 100–150 kJ mol−1. That said, we note that the interplay of the two metrics together, and not just the energy consumption, defines the figures of merit relevant to practical DAC operation and plant design. We note below that the physical solubility of the CO2 in the electrolyte plays an important role in dictating the overall performance of the system for any given quinone loading.\n",

Figure 7e indicates that the CO2 is adsorbed from the stagnant air filling the column before the next cycle is begun, but this step can be implicit in the first step of the next cycle.

      " The tangential research paper's main findings are significant for achieving the ultimate goal of proposing a more efficient carbon capture system. The paper presents an electrochemically mediated direct air capture (DAC) system that utilizes redox-active quinone moieties to capture and release CO2. The system relies solely on the electrochemical voltage for CO2 capture and release, eliminating the need for temperature or pH swing. The paper demonstrates the design and operation of a DAC system using stackable bipolar cells with poly(vinylanthraquinone) (PVAQ) negative electrodes. The system achieves CO2 capture from feed concentrations as low as 400 ppm and demonstrates energy consumption as low as 113 kJ per mole of CO2 captured.

      "The tangential research paper demonstrates that eCCC systems, particularly those using pH-mediated approaches with redox mediators, can capture and release carbon dioxide with high Faradaic efficiencies.

The paper also highlights the potential for modular designs and the use of low-carbon energy sources, making eCCC systems more attractive for large-scale deployment.\n",

      "One drawback demonstrated by the tangential research paper is the limited solubility and stability of some redox mediators, such as quinones, in aqueous solutions.

Further research is needed to optimize the stability, solubility, and performance of redox mediators in eCCC systems.\n",

      ", Accepted 18th December 2020First published on 18th December 2020AbstractElectrochemical CO2 capture technologies are gaining attention due to their flexibility, their ability to address decentralized emissions (e.g., ocean and atmosphere) and their fit in an electrified industry. In the present work, recent progress made in electrochemical CO2 capture is reviewed. The majority of these methods rely on the concept of “pH-swing” and the effect it has on the CO2 hydration/dehydration equilibrium. Through a pH-swing, CO2 can be captured and recovered by shifting the pH of a working fluid between acidic and basic pH. Such swing can be applied electrochemically through electrolysis, bipolar membrane electrodialysis, reversible redox reactions and capacitive deionization. In this review, we summarize main parameters governing these electrochemical pH-swing processes and put the concept in the framework of available worldwide capture technologies. We analyse the energy efficiency and consumption of such systems, and provide recommendations for further improvements. Although electrochemical CO2 capture technologies are rather costly compared to the amine based capture, they can be particularly interesting if more affordable renewable electricity and materials (e.g., electrode and membranes) become widely available. Furthermore, electrochemical methods have the ability to (directly) convert the captured CO2 to value added chemicals and fuels, and hence prepare for a fully electrified circular carbon economy.\n",

      "Broader context\n",
      "The necessity of taking actions to achieve a net zero CO2 emission has brought up the question “how to achieve a circular carbon economy?”. To close the carbon cycle, sustainable CO2 capture and utilization are indispensable. Current technologies for CO2 capture rely dominantly on absorption of CO2 from flue gas, regenerated via energy-intensive temperature swings, which imply a huge energy consumption when expanding capture towards a net zero CO2 emission. When also realizing that approximately 40% of the CO2 emission is decentralized, which may even increase when power plants and industry are transitioning to renewable energy, we are facing a massive challenge for closing the carbon cycle. In that framework, electrochemical technologies for CO2 capture, from the atmosphere, ocean, and flue gas, can play an important role. The installed renewable electricity generation capacity is increasing each year, with more than 2300 GW in 2018. However, currently, most electrochemical methods are at early stages of development and are still energy intensive. In this contribution, we evaluate each of these technologies while focusing on the pH-swing approach. We establish the current state of the art, describe the major technical barriers and R&D needs, and discuss opportunities for improving electrochemical CO2 capture.\n",
      "1 Introduction\n",
      "To honour the Paris Agreement, a global net zero greenhouse gasses (GHG) emission needs to be realized by the end of this century.1–3 Among all GHG's, CO2(g) is accepted to be the main anthropogenic control knob on the climate and has been the focus of many studies.4,5 To achieve a net zero emission,6 reducing the total CO2 emission obtains most impact in the short term.7 The largest CO2 emission is due to combustion of fossil fuels and thus can be reduced through fossil fuels phase out. However, although ultimately fossil fuels phase out might be possible for the power industry and transportation sector (through substitution with renewable energy), many sectors (e.g., steel/cement production, intercontinental air transport or non electrical trains) do not have a suitable alternative for carbon based fuels. In addition, due to the current agriculture techniques, the net global deforestation and the growing demand for carbon as a resource, CO2 will be emitted due to many anthropogenic activities. Therefore, to achieve a net zero GHG's emission, in addition to emission reduction, CO2 capture and utilization is required in the long term. Also, as the long term CO2 emitters include decentralized emitters, direct capture from CO2 sinks (e.g., atmosphere and ocean, see Fig. 1 is necessary for effectively addressing the anthropogenic CO2 emissions.8,9\n",

      "Schematic of the carbon cycle. The total carbon reserve is shown in gigatonnes of carbon (GtC). The global GHG emissions in CO2(eq) by economic sectors: 25% electricity and heat production, 24% agriculture, forestry and land use, 6% buildings, 14% transportation, 21% industry and 10% other energy usages. Data extracted from ref. 10–12.\n",
      "The main challenge that currently available CO2 capture methods face is a high energy consumption.13–15 A few mature, non-electrochemical CO2 capture technologies e.g., absorption, adsorption, membrane separation and cryogenic capture are already available in industrial scales,16–25 Section 4. These methods often depend on the availability of thermal energy, which makes them less well suited for CO2 capture from dilute sources e.g., air and ocean. Furthermore, the cost of direct air capture via traditional technologies has been estimated in the literature from $100 to $1000 per tonne of captured CO2.3,26–28\n",
      "Electrochemical processes have the potential to be rather energy efficient as they can target molecules directly (instead of the medium surrounding them).29,30 Using electrochemistry for CO2 capture dates back to the late 1960s, when molten carbonates as electrolyte were used for CO2 control in a manned spacecraft.31–34 Nowadays, electrochemical CO2 capture methods can be applied to all CO2 containing streams with any concentration. Direct capture from air,35 ocean8,36 and flue gas37–39 have been reported. Such capture units can be retrofitted as plug-and-play processes, allow small footprints and are geometrically flexible.39,40 They do not require external sources of heat or high pressures/vacuum for operation, nor degradation of sorbent material is expected.40 Although heat integration can be beneficial for power plants in reducing the need for energy, other industries (e.g., food and water sector) cannot integrate high heat, rising the need for technologies that can perform under low heat conditions from centralized emitters as well.14 In electrochemical systems, the electric potential gradient is the main driving force which can be controlled precisely to drive chemical reactions isothermally.29,30,41 A number of bench-scale capture demonstrations via electrochemical pH-swing have obtained CO2 capture and release at the promising value of ∼100 kJ mol−1 CO2.42,43\n",
      "The added advantage of the electrochemical methods is their ability to integrate CO2 capture and utilization44 (Section 5). An example is the modular, sequential CO2 capture and conversion system that uses the pH-swing concept to produce CO electrochemically.45,46 In addition, reactive CO2 capture, in which the CO2 capturing medium pre-concentrates the dilute feed and produces favorable local micro-environments, has become an emerging field for integrated CO2 capture and conversion using electrochemical techniques.47,48\n",
      "A wide variety of efforts to electrochemically capture CO2 has been demonstrated in the past 50 years, with an intensification of research activities in the last two decades. In this work we give an overview of such advances. The center of our scope are the electrochemical methods that use a pH-swing concept, as shown in Fig. 2a and b. The swing refers to (electrochemically) shifting the pH of a working fluid (continuously) between basic and acidic pH to influence the CO2 equilibrium to capture and recover CO2.\n",

      "The pH-swing allows absorption and desorption at ambient temperature and does not require use of any special chemicals. Widely available, inexpensive, non toxic/non corrosive/non volatile salt solutions, such as NaCl, KCl, KHCO3 or even seawater can be used for the process. The pH-swing can be applied electrochemically using electrolysis, bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPMED), capacitive deionization and reversible PCET agents as demonstrated in Fig. 3. In this work, after providing the required theoretical background in Section 2, each pH-swing route is explained and the research of this route is comprehensive reviewed in Section 3. In addition to a pH-swing approach, other electrochemical technologies involve using redox-active carriers49 (Section 3.3), molten carbonate cells and hybrid methods (Section 3.4) such as electrochemically enhanced absorption/adsorption.29,30 To enable comparison, we also briefly describe the main conventional capture methods, their drawbacks and advantages, and opportunities to improve these technologies with electrochemical methods, in Section 4. Finally, CO2 utilization and storage is discussed briefly in section to close the carbon cycle (Section 5).\n",

      "2 Theory: pH-swing concept and involved reactions\n",
      "The concept of CO2 capture via pH-swing leverages the responsiveness of the thermodynamic equilibrium of CO2 to pH changes. A pH-swing is also used for other resource recovery applications than CO2 capture, but the method is not always explicitly referred to as “pH-swing”. For instance, pH-swing is employed to recover ammonia electrochemically from urine50,51 and to remove phosphate from waste water streams.52\n",
      "2.1 Carbonate equilibrium\n",
      "The carbonate equilibrium can be described as open or closed based on the contact with an overlying gas and is explained in detail in ref. 53–56. In an open system, the total concentration of the dissolved inorganic carbon varies by changing in the pH; acidification results in CO2(g) out-gassing, while basification lead to more CO2(g) absorption, increasing the DIC. In a closed system (e.g., inside of an electrochemical cell), the total DIC remains constant regardless of any pH changes. If so, the dominant carbonic species alter by changing the pH as demonstrated in Fig. 2a. The equilibrium can be shown through reactions (1)–(4): CO2(g) ⇌ CO2(aq)(1) (2) (3) (4)Reaction (1) is dependent on the fugacity of CO2(g) and often described through Henry's law (see Section 2.3). It is often assumed to be really fast (i.e., 1010 s−1 in both directions) in a well-mixed scenario (i.e., only mass-transport limited).55,57,58 For experimental values of k1, k−1, k2, k−2 see ref. 57, 59 and 60. As the pH increases, reaction (3) pushes the equilibrium towards HCO3−, and it predominates reaction (2) above pH 8.5.59 See Section 2.2 for more discussion on the kinetics of the reactions. The total dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC, can be described as the summation of the concentration of all present carbonic species: DIC = [H2CO3*] + [HCO3−] + [CO32−](5)where H2CO3* = H2CO3 + CO2(aq). In multi-ionic systems, additional carbonate species or complexes (e.g., NaCO3− and NaHCO3(aq)) are present in the definition of DIC, as well.61,62\n",
      "2.2 Reactions kinetics and how to improve it\n",
      "To capture and release CO2(g) through a pH-swing, both thermodynamics and kinetics play a role.57,59 Assuming thermodynamic equilibrium, the equilibrium ratio of\n",
      "changes by a factor of more than 100 over when using a small pH-swing of only 2 pH-units, see Fig. 2a. However, although such a narrow pH-swing is thermodynamically favourable and enables lower energy consumption, it suffers from slow kinetics. At near neutral pH, the CO2 hydration rate is ∼2.9 × 10−2 s−1 and the (HCO3−) dehydration rate is ∼2 × 10−4 s−1.42,60 These reaction rates are a function of e.g. temperature and ionic strength of the system.63–65 To overcome the slow kinetics, (1) a wider range of pH-swing or (2) a reaction catalyst need to be applied. As for a wider pH-swing range, the base promoted hydration rate of the CO2/HCO3− system is reported to be ∼6 × 103 M−1 s−1 and the acid-promoted dehydration rate is increased to ∼4.1 × 104 M−1 s−1.42,59,60,65 Alternatively, the use of a catalyst such as the carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzyme66 is suggested for improving the kinetics.42,67,68 CA is reported to enhance both the CO2 hydration and dehydration reaction kinetics; hydration rate constant ∼105 s−1 and dehydration rate constant ∼106 s−1 near a neutral pH of 7 are reported.66 However, although initially effective, such enzyme is not stable, and is prone to enzyme loss, deactivation, or degradation. Investigation on improved catalysts is recommended, but until such catalysts are developed, to effectively capture and recover CO2, a wider range of pH-swing (pH < pKa1 and pKa2 < pH) is needed for capture application.\n",
      "2.3 Inorganic carbon solubility\n",
      "In equilibrium, the concentration of free CO2 in water (i.e., [CO2(aq)]) is proportional to its partial pressure in the gas phase; according to the Henrys law, [CO2(aq)] = K0 × fCO2(g) where K0 (in mol L−1 atm−1) is the solubility coefficient of CO2(g) and fCO2(g) stands for the gas fugacity (in atm), which is close to the partial pressure of CO2(g) (within 1%). Fig. 4a shows the solubility of CO2 as a function of temperature and CO2 partial pressure. At elevated alkalinity, the total solubility of CO2(g), and hence DIC (in eqn (5)) increases due to reaction (3) route. Fig. 4b shows the solubility of DIC as a function of the water pH and the partial pressure of CO2. See the ESI† for the used equations and references.\n",

      "Fig. 5 demonstrates input parameters and the metrics of electrochemical CO2 capture based on a pH-swing. The feed, cell, process and kinetics can be leveraged for the product/output. The main challenge such capture technologies are facing is their (estimated) high Capex, resulted from a high energy consumption and the immaturity of the technology.3 Data on Capex of electrochemical methods is still scarce, making the energy consumption (at high current density and capture efficiency) the most practical metric of comparison. Thankfully, despite the currently high energy consumption, optimization of the process and cell parameters can significantly decrease the energy loss involved in such processes as explained in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.5.\n",

In this section we introduce each method separately and compare them in terms of feasibility, energy consumption, energy efficiency and technology readiness level (TRL).\n",

      "Electrolysis can enable the pH-swing in the vicinity of (two) electrodes as shown in Fig. 6. (Membrane) electrolysis for CO2 capture is used for alkali absorbent (re)generation38,69–73 or simultaneous H2 production.36,74–76 H2 production can (partially) offset the cost of CO2 capture and is possible when water electrolysis takes place. In the earliest work done by Stucki et al., CO2 is absorbed from a flue gas in an KOH absorbent, the resulted (bi)carbonate solution is fed into the electrolyser (for alkaline regeneration), where CO2 is recovered and H2 is produced via the following reaction: 2H2O + K2CO3(aq) → 2KOH(aq) + CO2(g) + H2(g) + 0.5O2(g)(6)The KOH can be used as absorbent for capturing CO2, turning into K2CO3(aq), which can be fed again to the electrolysis system.\n",

      "One downside in such systems is that the cell voltage has, in addition to 1.23 V for water splitting, a contribution from the pH difference between the anolyte and the catholyte, represented by Nernstian potential of Φ = 0.059ΔpH (in volts) at 25 °C, as shown in the Pourbaix diagram (Fig. 7).74 When using an extreme pH gradient (pH 0 at anode, pH 14 at cathode), this would imply a 2.06 V for balancing the free enthalpy of the reaction.\n",

      "Using the pH-swing in electrolysis, the CO2 can be either released as (purified) gas (e.g., viareaction (6)), or as (bi)carbonate products in the work of Rau and Park et al.70,71,75,78 The latter has been demonstrated for Ca(HCO3)2(aq) (Fig. 8a) and71,75 solid carbonate mineral as shown in Fig. 8b.70 Natural (mined and crushed) carbonate minerals are used to provide Ca2+ in Fig. 8a. Through reaction (7), CO2 can be removed from an overlying gas mixture (e.g., air or flue gas). The produced Ca(HCO3)2(aq) can be diluted and stored in the ocean, water reservoirs or underground: 2H2O + CaCO3(s) + CO2(g) → Ca(HCO3)2(aq) + H2(g) + 0.5O2(g)(7)Capture of 1 mole of CO2(g) for each mole of CaCO3viareaction (7) is possible, while 22 tonnes of CO2 can be captured per tonne H2 generated (assuming a 1:1 molar ratio).71 This implies that, depending on CO2 emission involved in the operation (e.g., for supplying electricity and for limestone/carbonate mining, crushing and transport), the system has the potential of producing carbon-negative hydrogen.79\n",

      "Alternative to water electrolysis, salt electrolysis, such as NaCl69 and KCl38 can also be used for CO2 capture. If so, only an alkaline pH (at the cathode) is enabled, because at the anode e.g., the reaction 2Cl− → Cl2(g) + 2e− takes place instead of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).70 The produced alkalinity at the cathode can then be utilized to sequestrate CO2 in the form of carbonate salts. When the capture product is CaCO3(s), no CO2(g) desorption step is required. Furthermore, CaCO3 is easier to transport and store compared to CO2(g). NaCl electrolysis for alkaline absorbent (re)generation follows reaction (8):69 2H2O + 2NaCl(aq) → 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)(8)Using salt electrolysis for CO2 capture is especially interesting due to salt availability in the seawater, leveraging possible substitution of the electrolyte with abundant seawater.69 The produced (toxic) Cl2(g) at the anode can be treated by the produced NaOH solution using a scrubber, or can alternatively be utilized as a feedstock for the synthesis of HCl, Cl containing polymers and bleaching agents.69 Alternatively, using water electrolysis and by inserting two ion exchange membranes (IEMs) between the electrodes (Fig. 9), produces H2 simultaneous acidifies seawater to recover CO2(g).36,80,81 The use of two IEMs avoids the production of Cl2(g) and electrode contamination.\n",

      "When applying electrolysis using a reversible redox reaction – thus no net gas production – saves energy. For example, the production of O2(g) (or Cl2(g)) can be avoided by recirculating the produced H2(g) from the cathode to the anode compartment.72,73 Alternatively, H2 production can be avoided if O2 reduction takes place on the cathode, instead of the H2O reduction.82 At the cathode, depending on availability of O2 or H2, two possible reactions may exist for OH− production: 2H2O + O2 + 4e− → 4OH− (E0 = 0.401 V vs. SHE)(9) 4H2O + 4e− → 2H2(g) + 4OH− (E0 = −0.83 V vs. SHE)(10)When sufficient O2 is available at the cathode, or sufficient H2 at the anode, the H+/OH− generation can take place in a practical cell voltage range of 1.3 V to 2.2 V through reaction (9). The supply of sufficient gas to the opposing electrode can be assisted by using gas diffusion electrodes.83 Without recirculating the gaseous products, the cell voltage is typically >2.2 V.82\n",
      "From a thermodynamic point of view, the use of (net) water electrolysis requires a significant thermodynamic minimum energy (1.23 V for water splitting), in addition to the potential required for generating a pH difference (see Fig. 7).77,84 Considering the necessity of a wide pH-swing to enhance the carbon equilibrium kinetics, and using pH 0 and 14 to favour electrolyte conductivity, a minimum of 2.06 V is required, corresponding to 199 kJ mol−1 CO2. Furthermore, in almost all demonstrated devices/systems, the rate of CO2 capture is locked with the rate of H2 or O2 generation, which sometimes may not be desirable and present additional challenges for multi-stack development of the system. These drawbacks can be addressed using bipolar membrane electrodialysis as explained in the following section.\n",
      "3.2 Bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPMED)\n",
      "A bipolar membrane (BPM) consists of an anion (AEL) and a cation (CEL) exchange layers, laminated together. When a sufficient electric field is applied, the BPM dissociates water into OH− and H+, producing a controllable ΔpH over the membrane as shown in Fig. 10a and b.85–90 Using a bipolar membrane, the thermodynamic minimum voltage required for this water dissociation is 0.829 volts for a produced ΔpH = 14. That is 2.5 times lower than that of water electrolysis at the same ΔpH = 14 (1.23 + 0.829 at minimum), as no gas evolution takes place using a bipolar membrane.85 The thermodynamic voltages over the BPM are even lower for smaller ΔpH over the membrane.84,88 The feasibility of using bipolar membrane electrodialysis for pH-swing based CO2 capture is shown in early studies in 1995;91 alkaline KOH and acidic H2SO4 were regenerated in a two compartment BPMED cell, containing a BPM and a cation exchange membrane. After CO2 from air is captured in KOH absorbent, it can be recovered through acidification. The produced K2SO4 is treated in the BPMED cell to regenerate the desired acid and base again. CO2 capture via BPMED has been further explored by others, and these works are addressed in more details in next sections.\n",

      "3.2.1 Energy consumption and capture efficiency.\n",
      "In BPMED, a trade off between the energy consumption and the process rate, determined by the applied current density, exists. Operating at very low current densities is not effective due to the higher salt ion leakage through the BPM and hence the lower water dissociation rate.92 On the other hand, at high current densities, the ohmic voltage losses increase, leading to an undesirable higher energy consumption (see ESI†). As an example, Fig. 11a shows the minimum energy consumption for CO2(g) recovery from 0.125 M K2CO3-rich solution via BPMED at a current density around 10 mA cm−2.3 However, although the energy consumption is the lowest at that current density, production rate favours higher current densities as shown in Fig. 11c. The experimentally measured current efficiency (i.e., faradaic efficiency) in Fig. 11b shows – in addition to its low values at i < 10 mA cm−2 due to salt cross-over – a slight decreases at i > 20 mA cm−2. It is hypothesized that current densities above the optimum value, reduce the BPM's permselectivity93 or enhance the water splitting reaction in the AEM's,94,95 leading to a lower efficiency.92 The current efficiency also decreases if the current is carried by an undesired ion through the membranes. For example, in Fig. 10b, the (bi)carbonate ions are the desired current carriers. However, if (as a result of high pH) OH− ions become the main charge carrier through the AEM, the current efficiency decreases. On the other hand, when capturing CO2(g) from flue gas or in DAC, a high pH (i.e., high [OH−]) is favoured in the outlet of the same compartment, because CO2(g) absorption capacity and rate increase in a solution with high pH. Adopting monovalent-ion-selective AEM's that favour the transport of HCO3− ions over OH− ions then could improve the efficiency when such process is intended.3,96\n",

      "The cell configuration defines the number of membranes, membrane cell pair arrangement, electrolyte flow path and the thickness of the compartment/membrane. The design of the cell is the most important factor to minimize the cell resistance.74 As opposed to the BPMED for traditional acid and base production (i.e., BPM–CEM–AEM–BPM), the pH-swing process for CO2 capture allows a simplified membrane sequence due to the limited pH-range (i.e., pH 3–9 instead of 0–14).\n",
      "In choosing the optimised configuration, the (co-)ionic leakage of the membranes is crucial. When using multi-ionic CO2 feed, such as seawater, carbonic species should be rejected to obtain a maximum capture efficiency. Carbonic species are neutral (e.g., CO2(aq) and H2CO3) or negatively charged and hence are rejected better by a CEM than by an AEM. In addition to higher selectivity, the use of CEM's instead of AEM's have proven to increase conductivity and mechanical stability in a BPMED cell for CO2 capture72).103\n",
      "For further reducing co-ionic cross-over, a trade off between the permselectivity of IEM's and their resistance should be considered, which is controlled by the membrane thickness. In general, thicker membranes have higher resistivity but show a better selectivity.72 Applying a reinforced structure to a thinner membrane can improve its selectivity while maintaining its resistivity to a certain extent.72,104\n",
      "Depending on the charge carriers in the cell, the flow mode (i.e., one-way pass vs. batch mode) and feed concentration, each BPMED process asks for a different cell configuration. While BPM–CEM might be the choice of some researchers for CO2 recovery from carbonate solutions,105,106 others chose a BPM–AEM43,92 for the same purpose.

This concentration can lead to the formation of CO2(g) bubbles inside of the cell. Theoretical models, suggest the trapped CO2 in the acid solution dominate the cell resistance and increase the energy consumption.108 Trapped gas bubbles lower the effective membrane surface area, cause high voltages and shorten the membrane lifetime (due to localized “hot spots” of high current density). To avoid gas production inside of the cell, Eisaman et al.43 proposed a high pressure BPMED process using a similar cell as shown in Fig. 10b where the entire stack is kept at high pressure, i.e., there is no pressure difference across the membranes in the stack. The authors observed that by increasing the pressure, the total cell voltage decreases due to the avoided CO2 gas bubbles production in the cell; the electrochemical energy required at 6 atm (333 kJ mol−1 CO2) was seen to be 29% less than that of 1.5 atm (471 kJ mol−1 CO2) at a current density of 139 mA cm−2.\n",

The ocean contain DIC of ∼2.3–2.5 mM, mainly in the form of HCO3− ions, in normal seawater of pH ∼ 8.1.\n",
      "The product of seawater CO2 capture can be (1) gaseous CO2,8 (2) solid carbonates,107 or (3) dissolved bicarbonates and carbonates ions (to be subsequently stored in the ocean).71,75,78,112 To extract the CO2 as gas, the bi-/carbonate ions present in the seawater can be converted into H2CO3* in the acidic compartments adjacent to the BPM.113 Subsequently, through vacuum stripping of the acidified stream using membrane contactors, CO2(g) can then be produced.8,113 Alternatively, at alkaline pH > pKa2, HCO3− converts to CO32− and can subsequently precipitate through reaction with dissolved Mg2+ or Ca2+.8,107 When the partial pressure of CO2 remains unchanged, the pH determines which mineral is obtained e.g., the precipitation of CaCO3 (in synthetic seawater) is favoured in 9.3 < pH < 9.6.8,114 Considering that the Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations in seawater are respectively ×4 and ×25 higher than that of DIC, mineralization has the potential to remove all DIC, theoretically.115 In addition, mineralization eliminates the expenses of using a membrane contactor.116,117 In the third option, converting CO2 to dissolved alkaline bicarbonates and carbonates enables carbon sequestration. This is a long-term carbon storage which also helps against ocean acidification by increasing the ocean alkalinity.71,75,78,112 However, further research is required for understanding the full range and capacity of such approach.\n",

In order to improve the kinetics of the precipitation, use of a seeded crystallizer unit is suggested.107,118 Although seawater CO2 capture through mineralization is shown feasible, debates on the environmental impacts of reducing Ca2+/Mg2+ concentration of the ocean are in progress.115,119\n",

The paper discusses the concept of pH-swing, where CO2 can be captured and recovered by shifting the pH of a working fluid between acidic and basic pH. This pH-swing can be applied electrochemically through electrolysis, bipolar membrane electrodialysis, reversible redox reactions, and capacitive deionization. By utilizing these electrochemical methods, CO2 can be captured directly from the atmosphere, ocean, and flue gas. The paper also highlights the potential for electrochemical methods to convert the captured CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels, contributing to a fully electrified circular carbon economy.\n",

The cost of direct air capture using traditional technologies has been estimated to be high, ranging from $100 to $1000 per tonne of captured CO2. Another drawback is the immaturity of the technology, as most electrochemical methods are still at early stages of development.\n",

      "In summary, the tangential research paper's main findings on electrochemical CO2 capture provide valuable insights into more energy-efficient carbon capture systems. The use of pH-swing and electrochemical methods can enable direct capture of CO2 from various sources and have the potential to convert the captured CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels. However, the high energy consumption and immaturity of the technology are current drawbacks that need to be addressed for these methods to be more efficient and cost-effective.\n",

      ", Accepted 18th December 2020First published on 18th December 2020AbstractElectrochemical CO2 capture technologies are gaining attention due to their flexibility, their ability to address decentralized emissions (e.g., ocean and atmosphere) and their fit in an electrified industry. In the present work, recent progress made in electrochemical CO2 capture is reviewed. The majority of these methods rely on the concept of “pH-swing” and the effect it has on the CO2 hydration/dehydration equilibrium. Through a pH-swing, CO2 can be captured and recovered by shifting the pH of a working fluid between acidic and basic pH. Such swing can be applied electrochemically through electrolysis, bipolar membrane electrodialysis, reversible redox reactions and capacitive deionization. In this review, we summarize main parameters governing these electrochemical pH-swing processes and put the concept in the framework of available worldwide capture technologies. We analyse the energy efficiency and consumption of such systems, and provide recommendations for further improvements. Although electrochemical CO2 capture technologies are rather costly compared to the amine based capture, they can be particularly interesting if more affordable renewable electricity and materials (e.g., electrode and membranes) become widely available. Furthermore, electrochemical methods have the ability to (directly) convert the captured CO2 to value added chemicals and fuels, and hence prepare for a fully electrified circular carbon economy.\n",

      "Broader context\n",
      "The necessity of taking actions to achieve a net zero CO2 emission has brought up the question “how to achieve a circular carbon economy?”. To close the carbon cycle, sustainable CO2 capture and utilization are indispensable. Current technologies for CO2 capture rely dominantly on absorption of CO2 from flue gas, regenerated via energy-intensive temperature swings, which imply a huge energy consumption when expanding capture towards a net zero CO2 emission. When also realizing that approximately 40% of the CO2 emission is decentralized, which may even increase when power plants and industry are transitioning to renewable energy, we are facing a massive challenge for closing the carbon cycle. In that framework, electrochemical technologies for CO2 capture, from the atmosphere, ocean, and flue gas, can play an important role. The installed renewable electricity generation capacity is increasing each year, with more than 2300 GW in 2018. However, currently, most electrochemical methods are at early stages of development and are still energy intensive. In this contribution, we evaluate each of these technologies while focusing on the pH-swing approach. We establish the current state of the art, describe the major technical barriers and R&D needs, and discuss opportunities for improving electrochemical CO2 capture.\n",
      "1 Introduction\n",
      "To honour the Paris Agreement, a global net zero greenhouse gasses (GHG) emission needs to be realized by the end of this century.1–3 Among all GHG's, CO2(g) is accepted to be the main anthropogenic control knob on the climate and has been the focus of many studies.4,5 To achieve a net zero emission,6 reducing the total CO2 emission obtains most impact in the short term.7 The largest CO2 emission is due to combustion of fossil fuels and thus can be reduced through fossil fuels phase out. However, although ultimately fossil fuels phase out might be possible for the power industry and transportation sector (through substitution with renewable energy), many sectors (e.g., steel/cement production, intercontinental air transport or non electrical trains) do not have a suitable alternative for carbon based fuels. In addition, due to the current agriculture techniques, the net global deforestation and the growing demand for carbon as a resource, CO2 will be emitted due to many anthropogenic activities. Therefore, to achieve a net zero GHG's emission, in addition to emission reduction, CO2 capture and utilization is required in the long term. Also, as the long term CO2 emitters include decentralized emitters, direct capture from CO2 sinks (e.g., atmosphere and ocean, see Fig. 1 is necessary for effectively addressing the anthropogenic CO2 emissions.8,9\n",

Data extracted from ref. 10–12.\n",
      "The main challenge that currently available CO2 capture methods face is a high energy consumption.13–15 A few mature, non-electrochemical CO2 capture technologies e.g., absorption, adsorption, membrane separation and cryogenic capture are already available in industrial scales,16–25 Section 4. These methods often depend on the availability of thermal energy, which makes them less well suited for CO2 capture from dilute sources e.g., air and ocean. Furthermore, the cost of direct air capture via traditional technologies has been estimated in the literature from $100 to $1000 per tonne of captured CO2.3,26–28\n",
      "Electrochemical processes have the potential to be rather energy efficient as they can target molecules directly (instead of the medium surrounding them).29,30 Using electrochemistry for CO2 capture dates back to the late 1960s, when molten carbonates as electrolyte were used for CO2 control in a manned spacecraft.31–34 Nowadays, electrochemical CO2 capture methods can be applied to all CO2 containing streams with any concentration. Direct capture from air,35 ocean8,36 and flue gas37–39 have been reported. Such capture units can be retrofitted as plug-and-play processes, allow small footprints and are geometrically flexible.39,40 They do not require external sources of heat or high pressures/vacuum for operation, nor degradation of sorbent material is expected.40 Although heat integration can be beneficial for power plants in reducing the need for energy, other industries (e.g., food and water sector) cannot integrate high heat, rising the need for technologies that can perform under low heat conditions from centralized emitters as well.14 In electrochemical systems, the electric potential gradient is the main driving force which can be controlled precisely to drive chemical reactions isothermally.29,30,41 A number of bench-scale capture demonstrations via electrochemical pH-swing have obtained CO2 capture and release at the promising value of ∼100 kJ mol−1 CO2.42,43\n",
      "The added advantage of the electrochemical methods is their ability to integrate CO2 capture and utilization44 (Section 5). An example is the modular, sequential CO2 capture and conversion system that uses the pH-swing concept to produce CO electrochemically.45,46 In addition, reactive CO2 capture, in which the CO2 capturing medium pre-concentrates the dilute feed and produces favorable local micro-environments, has become an emerging field for integrated CO2 capture and conversion using electrochemical techniques.47,48\n",
      "A wide variety of efforts to electrochemically capture CO2 has been demonstrated in the past 50 years, with an intensification of research activities in the last two decades. In this work we give an overview of such advances. The center of our scope are the electrochemical methods that use a pH-swing concept, as shown in Fig. 2a and b. The swing refers to (electrochemically) shifting the pH of a working fluid (continuously) between basic and acidic pH to influence the CO2 equilibrium to capture and recover CO2.\n",

      "The pH-swing allows absorption and desorption at ambient temperature and does not require use of any special chemicals. Widely available, inexpensive, non toxic/non corrosive/non volatile salt solutions, such as NaCl, KCl, KHCO3 or even seawater can be used for the process. The pH-swing can be applied electrochemically using electrolysis, bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPMED), capacitive deionization and reversible PCET agents as demonstrated in Fig. 3. In this work, after providing the required theoretical background in Section 2, each pH-swing route is explained and the research of this route is comprehensive reviewed in Section 3. In addition to a pH-swing approach, other electrochemical technologies involve using redox-active carriers49 (Section 3.3), molten carbonate cells and hybrid methods (Section 3.4) such as electrochemically enhanced absorption/adsorption.29,30 To enable comparison, we also briefly describe the main conventional capture methods, their drawbacks and advantages, and opportunities to improve these technologies with electrochemical methods, in Section 4. Finally, CO2 utilization and storage is discussed briefly in section to close the carbon cycle (Section 5).\n",

      "2 Theory: pH-swing concept and involved reactions\n",
      "The concept of CO2 capture via pH-swing leverages the responsiveness of the thermodynamic equilibrium of CO2 to pH changes. A pH-swing is also used for other resource recovery applications than CO2 capture, but the method is not always explicitly referred to as “pH-swing”. For instance, pH-swing is employed to recover ammonia electrochemically from urine50,51 and to remove phosphate from waste water streams.52\n",
      "2.1 Carbonate equilibrium\n",
      "The carbonate equilibrium can be described as open or closed based on the contact with an overlying gas and is explained in detail in ref. 53–56. In an open system, the total concentration of the dissolved inorganic carbon varies by changing in the pH; acidification results in CO2(g) out-gassing, while basification lead to more CO2(g) absorption, increasing the DIC. In a closed system (e.g., inside of an electrochemical cell), the total DIC remains constant regardless of any pH changes. If so, the dominant carbonic species alter by changing the pH as demonstrated in Fig. 2a. The equilibrium can be shown through reactions (1)–(4): CO2(g) ⇌ CO2(aq)(1) (2) (3) (4)Reaction (1) is dependent on the fugacity of CO2(g) and often described through Henry's law (see Section 2.3). It is often assumed to be really fast (i.e., 1010 s−1 in both directions) in a well-mixed scenario (i.e., only mass-transport limited).55,57,58 For experimental values of k1, k−1, k2, k−2 see ref. 57, 59 and 60. As the pH increases, reaction (3) pushes the equilibrium towards HCO3−, and it predominates reaction (2) above pH 8.5.59 See Section 2.2 for more discussion on the kinetics of the reactions. The total dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC, can be described as the summation of the concentration of all present carbonic species: DIC = [H2CO3*] + [HCO3−] + [CO32−](5)where H2CO3* = H2CO3 + CO2(aq). In multi-ionic systems, additional carbonate species or complexes (e.g., NaCO3− and NaHCO3(aq)) are present in the definition of DIC, as well.61,62\n",

      "To capture and release CO2(g) through a pH-swing, both thermodynamics and kinetics play a role.57,59 Assuming thermodynamic equilibrium, the equilibrium ratio of\n",
      "changes by a factor of more than 100 over when using a small pH-swing of only 2 pH-units, see Fig. 2a. However, although such a narrow pH-swing is thermodynamically favourable and enables lower energy consumption, it suffers from slow kinetics. At near neutral pH, the CO2 hydration rate is ∼2.9 × 10−2 s−1 and the (HCO3−) dehydration rate is ∼2 × 10−4 s−1.42,60 These reaction rates are a function of e.g. temperature and ionic strength of the system.63–65 To overcome the slow kinetics, (1) a wider range of pH-swing or (2) a reaction catalyst need to be applied. As for a wider pH-swing range, the base promoted hydration rate of the CO2/HCO3− system is reported to be ∼6 × 103 M−1 s−1 and the acid-promoted dehydration rate is increased to ∼4.1 × 104 M−1 s−1.42,59,60,65 Alternatively, the use of a catalyst such as the carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzyme66 is suggested for improving the kinetics.42,67,68 CA is reported to enhance both the CO2 hydration and dehydration reaction kinetics; hydration rate constant ∼105 s−1 and dehydration rate constant ∼106 s−1 near a neutral pH of 7 are reported.66 However, although initially effective, such enzyme is not stable, and is prone to enzyme loss, deactivation, or degradation. Investigation on improved catalysts is recommended, but until such catalysts are developed, to effectively capture and recover CO2, a wider range of pH-swing (pH < pKa1 and pKa2 < pH) is needed for capture application.\n",
      "2.3 Inorganic carbon solubility\n",
      "In equilibrium, the concentration of free CO2 in water (i.e., [CO2(aq)]) is proportional to its partial pressure in the gas phase; according to the Henrys law, [CO2(aq)] = K0 × fCO2(g) where K0 (in mol L−1 atm−1) is the solubility coefficient of CO2(g) and fCO2(g) stands for the gas fugacity (in atm), which is close to the partial pressure of CO2(g) (within 1%). Fig. 4a shows the solubility of CO2 as a function of temperature and CO2 partial pressure. At elevated alkalinity, the total solubility of CO2(g), and hence DIC (in eqn (5)) increases due to reaction (3) route. Fig. 4b shows the solubility of DIC as a function of the water pH and the partial pressure of CO2. See the ESI† for the used equations and references.\n",

      "Fig. 5 demonstrates input parameters and the metrics of electrochemical CO2 capture based on a pH-swing. The feed, cell, process and kinetics can be leveraged for the product/output. The main challenge such capture technologies are facing is their (estimated) high Capex, resulted from a high energy consumption and the immaturity of the technology.3 Data on Capex of electrochemical methods is still scarce, making the energy consumption (at high current density and capture efficiency) the most practical metric of comparison. Thankfully, despite the currently high energy consumption, optimization of the process and cell parameters can significantly decrease the energy loss involved in such processes as explained in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.5.\n",

In this section we introduce each method separately and compare them in terms of feasibility, energy consumption, energy efficiency and technology readiness level (TRL).\n",

      "Electrolysis can enable the pH-swing in the vicinity of (two) electrodes as shown in Fig. 6. (Membrane) electrolysis for CO2 capture is used for alkali absorbent (re)generation38,69–73 or simultaneous H2 production.36,74–76 H2 production can (partially) offset the cost of CO2 capture and is possible when water electrolysis takes place. In the earliest work done by Stucki et al., CO2 is absorbed from a flue gas in an KOH absorbent, the resulted (bi)carbonate solution is fed into the electrolyser (for alkaline regeneration), where CO2 is recovered and H2 is produced via the following reaction: 2H2O + K2CO3(aq) → 2KOH(aq) + CO2(g) + H2(g) + 0.5O2(g)(6)The KOH can be used as absorbent for capturing CO2, turning into K2CO3(aq), which can be fed again to the electrolysis system.\n",

      "Schematic of water electrolysis. Depending on the catholyte/anolyte (air, water, etc.), applied voltage and the pH of the medium, different half reactions take place.\n",
      "One downside in such systems is that the cell voltage has, in addition to 1.23 V for water splitting, a contribution from the pH difference between the anolyte and the catholyte, represented by Nernstian potential of Φ = 0.059ΔpH (in volts) at 25 °C, as shown in the Pourbaix diagram (Fig. 7).74 When using an extreme pH gradient (pH 0 at anode, pH 14 at cathode), this would imply a 2.06 V for balancing the free enthalpy of the reaction.\n",

      "Pourbaix diagram of water electrolysis.77\n",
      "Using the pH-swing in electrolysis, the CO2 can be either released as (purified) gas (e.g., viareaction (6)), or as (bi)carbonate products in the work of Rau and Park et al.70,71,75,78 The latter has been demonstrated for Ca(HCO3)2(aq) (Fig. 8a) and71,75 solid carbonate mineral as shown in Fig. 8b.70 Natural (mined and crushed) carbonate minerals are used to provide Ca2+ in Fig. 8a. Through reaction (7), CO2 can be removed from an overlying gas mixture (e.g., air or flue gas). The produced Ca(HCO3)2(aq) can be diluted and stored in the ocean, water reservoirs or underground: 2H2O + CaCO3(s) + CO2(g) → Ca(HCO3)2(aq) + H2(g) + 0.5O2(g)(7)Capture of 1 mole of CO2(g) for each mole of CaCO3viareaction (7) is possible, while 22 tonnes of CO2 can be captured per tonne H2 generated (assuming a 1:1 molar ratio).71 This implies that, depending on CO2 emission involved in the operation (e.g., for supplying electricity and for limestone/carbonate mining, crushing and transport), the system has the potential of producing carbon-negative hydrogen.79\n",

      "The process efficiency in Fig. 8a can be enhanced e.g., by:\n",
      "• Improving the mass transfer between the overlying gas and the absorbent (to improve CO2(g) dissolution).\n",
      "• Introducing an ion selective membrane between the electrodes (to avoid unwanted secondary reactions).\n",
      "Alternative to water electrolysis, salt electrolysis, such as NaCl69 and KCl38 can also be used for CO2 capture. If so, only an alkaline pH (at the cathode) is enabled, because at the anode e.g., the reaction 2Cl− → Cl2(g) + 2e− takes place instead of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).70 The produced alkalinity at the cathode can then be utilized to sequestrate CO2 in the form of carbonate salts. When the capture product is CaCO3(s), no CO2(g) desorption step is required. Furthermore, CaCO3 is easier to transport and store compared to CO2(g). NaCl electrolysis for alkaline absorbent (re)generation follows reaction (8):69 2H2O + 2NaCl(aq) → 2NaOH(aq) + Cl2(g) + H2(g)(8)Using salt electrolysis for CO2 capture is especially interesting due to salt availability in the seawater, leveraging possible substitution of the electrolyte with abundant seawater.69 The produced (toxic) Cl2(g) at the anode can be treated by the produced NaOH solution using a scrubber, or can alternatively be utilized as a feedstock for the synthesis of HCl, Cl containing polymers and bleaching agents.69 Alternatively, using water electrolysis and by inserting two ion exchange membranes (IEMs) between the electrodes (Fig. 9), produces H2 simultaneous acidifies seawater to recover CO2(g).36,80,81 The use of two IEMs avoids the production of Cl2(g) and electrode contamination.\n",

      "When applying electrolysis using a reversible redox reaction – thus no net gas production – saves energy. For example, the production of O2(g) (or Cl2(g)) can be avoided by recirculating the produced H2(g) from the cathode to the anode compartment.72,73 Alternatively, H2 production can be avoided if O2 reduction takes place on the cathode, instead of the H2O reduction.82 At the cathode, depending on availability of O2 or H2, two possible reactions may exist for OH− production: 2H2O + O2 + 4e− → 4OH− (E0 = 0.401 V vs. SHE)(9) 4H2O + 4e− → 2H2(g) + 4OH− (E0 = −0.83 V vs. SHE)(10)When sufficient O2 is available at the cathode, or sufficient H2 at the anode, the H+/OH− generation can take place in a practical cell voltage range of 1.3 V to 2.2 V through reaction (9). The supply of sufficient gas to the opposing electrode can be assisted by using gas diffusion electrodes.83 Without recirculating the gaseous products, the cell voltage is typically >2.2 V.82\n",
      "From a thermodynamic point of view, the use of (net) water electrolysis requires a significant thermodynamic minimum energy (1.23 V for water splitting), in addition to the potential required for generating a pH difference (see Fig. 7).77,84 Considering the necessity of a wide pH-swing to enhance the carbon equilibrium kinetics, and using pH 0 and 14 to favour electrolyte conductivity, a minimum of 2.06 V is required, corresponding to 199 kJ mol−1 CO2. Furthermore, in almost all demonstrated devices/systems, the rate of CO2 capture is locked with the rate of H2 or O2 generation, which sometimes may not be desirable and present additional challenges for multi-stack development of the system. These drawbacks can be addressed using bipolar membrane electrodialysis as explained in the following section.\n",
      "3.2 Bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BPMED)\n",
      "A bipolar membrane (BPM) consists of an anion (AEL) and a cation (CEL) exchange layers, laminated together. When a sufficient electric field is applied, the BPM dissociates water into OH− and H+, producing a controllable ΔpH over the membrane as shown in Fig. 10a and b.85–90 Using a bipolar membrane, the thermodynamic minimum voltage required for this water dissociation is 0.829 volts for a produced ΔpH = 14. That is 2.5 times lower than that of water electrolysis at the same ΔpH = 14 (1.23 + 0.829 at minimum), as no gas evolution takes place using a bipolar membrane.85 The thermodynamic voltages over the BPM are even lower for smaller ΔpH over the membrane.84,88 The feasibility of using bipolar membrane electrodialysis for pH-swing based CO2 capture is shown in early studies in 1995;91 alkaline KOH and acidic H2SO4 were regenerated in a two compartment BPMED cell, containing a BPM and a cation exchange membrane. After CO2 from air is captured in KOH absorbent, it can be recovered through acidification. The produced K2SO4 is treated in the BPMED cell to regenerate the desired acid and base again. CO2 capture via BPMED has been further explored by others, and these works are addressed in more details in next sections.\n",

      "3.2.1 Energy consumption and capture efficiency.\n",
      "In BPMED, a trade off between the energy consumption and the process rate, determined by the applied current density, exists. Operating at very low current densities is not effective due to the higher salt ion leakage through the BPM and hence the lower water dissociation rate.92 On the other hand, at high current densities, the ohmic voltage losses increase, leading to an undesirable higher energy consumption (see ESI†). As an example, Fig. 11a shows the minimum energy consumption for CO2(g) recovery from 0.125 M K2CO3-rich solution via BPMED at a current density around 10 mA cm−2.3 However, although the energy consumption is the lowest at that current density, production rate favours higher current densities as shown in Fig. 11c. The experimentally measured current efficiency (i.e., faradaic efficiency) in Fig. 11b shows – in addition to its low values at i < 10 mA cm−2 due to salt cross-over – a slight decreases at i > 20 mA cm−2. It is hypothesized that current densities above the optimum value, reduce the BPM's permselectivity93 or enhance the water splitting reaction in the AEM's,94,95 leading to a lower efficiency.92 The current efficiency also decreases if the current is carried by an undesired ion through the membranes. For example, in Fig. 10b, the (bi)carbonate ions are the desired current carriers. However, if (as a result of high pH) OH− ions become the main charge carrier through the AEM, the current efficiency decreases. On the other hand, when capturing CO2(g) from flue gas or in DAC, a high pH (i.e., high [OH−]) is favoured in the outlet of the same compartment, because CO2(g) absorption capacity and rate increase in a solution with high pH. Adopting monovalent-ion-selective AEM's that favour the transport of HCO3− ions over OH− ions then could improve the efficiency when such process is intended.3,96\n",

      "The (slightly) positive effect of temperature on improving the faradaic efficiency of electrochemical methods has been reported.38,69 Higher temperatures improve the electrochemical reaction rates. In the case of BPMED, the kinetics of water dissociation in BPM is also enhanced at elevated temperatures.97,98 However, in addition to the extra energy needed for heating up the electrolytes, the thermal stability of the ion exchange membranes poses a limitation on high temperature processes. For instance, the commercial bipolar membranes are cannot withstand temperatures higher than 40–60 °C for a long duration.99 Moreover, CO2 solubility decrease at higher temperatures (up to 100 °C).100–102 This means that operating at high temperature is not yet practical.\n",

      "3.2.2 Cell configuration.\n",
      "The cell configuration defines the number of membranes, membrane cell pair arrangement, electrolyte flow path and the thickness of the compartment/membrane. The design of the cell is the most important factor to minimize the cell resistance.74 As opposed to the BPMED for traditional acid and base production (i.e., BPM–CEM–AEM–BPM), the pH-swing process for CO2 capture allows a simplified membrane sequence due to the limited pH-range (i.e., pH 3–9 instead of 0–14).\n",
      "In choosing the optimised configuration, the (co-)ionic leakage of the membranes is crucial. When using multi-ionic CO2 feed, such as seawater, carbonic species should be rejected to obtain a maximum capture efficiency. Carbonic species are neutral (e.g., CO2(aq) and H2CO3) or negatively charged and hence are rejected better by a CEM than by an AEM. In addition to higher selectivity, the use of CEM's instead of AEM's have proven to increase conductivity and mechanical stability in a BPMED cell for CO2 capture72).103\n",
      "For further reducing co-ionic cross-over, a trade off between the permselectivity of IEM's and their resistance should be considered, which is controlled by the membrane thickness. In general, thicker membranes have higher resistivity but show a better selectivity.72 Applying a reinforced structure to a thinner membrane can improve its selectivity while maintaining its resistivity to a certain extent.72,104\n",
      "Depending on the charge carriers in the cell, the flow mode (i.e., one-way pass vs. batch mode) and feed concentration, each BPMED process asks for a different cell configuration. While BPM–CEM might be the choice of some researchers for CO2 recovery from carbonate solutions,105,106 others chose a BPM–AEM43,92 for the same purpose. That is while novel configurations as BPM–AEM–AEM are also emerging for minimizing BPM fouling when extracting CaCO3 from seawater,107 see Section 3.2.4.\n",
      "3.2.3 High pressure BPMED.\n",
      "In a closed system (such as the one created inside of an electrochemical cell), acidification increases the concentration of dissolved CO2. This concentration can lead to the formation of CO2(g) bubbles inside of the cell. Theoretical models, suggest the trapped CO2 in the acid solution dominate the cell resistance and increase the energy consumption.108 Trapped gas bubbles lower the effective membrane surface area, cause high voltages and shorten the membrane lifetime (due to localized “hot spots” of high current density). To avoid gas production inside of the cell, Eisaman et al.43 proposed a high pressure BPMED process using a similar cell as shown in Fig. 10b where the entire stack is kept at high pressure, i.e., there is no pressure difference across the membranes in the stack. The authors observed that by increasing the pressure, the total cell voltage decreases due to the avoided CO2 gas bubbles production in the cell; the electrochemical energy required at 6 atm (333 kJ mol−1 CO2) was seen to be 29% less than that of 1.5 atm (471 kJ mol−1 CO2) at a current density of 139 mA cm−2.\n",
      "3.2.4 BPMED for CO2 extraction from seawater.\n",
      "The ocean is a massive sink for CO2.11,109,110 The higher carbon content of the oceans compared to that of the atmosphere8,54,111 makes the ocean an interesting source for CO2 capture.109 Moreover, as opposed to the separation of CO2 from a gas mixture that involves two steps (i.e., capture and release), in CO2 capture from seawater, a separate CO2(g) adsorption/absorption step is not required, because the ocean already acts as CO2 absorbent leveraging its gigantic surface. The ocean contain DIC of ∼2.3–2.5 mM, mainly in the form of HCO3− ions, in normal seawater of pH ∼ 8.1.\n",
      "The product of seawater CO2 capture can be (1) gaseous CO2,8 (2) solid carbonates,107 or (3) dissolved bicarbonates and carbonates ions (to be subsequently stored in the ocean).71,75,78,112 To extract the CO2 as gas, the bi-/carbonate ions present in the seawater can be converted into H2CO3* in the acidic compartments adjacent to the BPM.113 Subsequently, through vacuum stripping of the acidified stream using membrane contactors, CO2(g) can then be produced.8,113 Alternatively, at alkaline pH > pKa2, HCO3− converts to CO32− and can subsequently precipitate through reaction with dissolved Mg2+ or Ca2+.8,107 When the partial pressure of CO2 remains unchanged, the pH determines which mineral is obtained e.g., the precipitation of CaCO3 (in synthetic seawater) is favoured in 9.3 < pH < 9.6.8,114 Considering that the Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations in seawater are respectively ×4 and ×25 higher than that of DIC, mineralization has the potential to remove all DIC, theoretically.115 In addition, mineralization eliminates the expenses of using a membrane contactor.116,117 In the third option, converting CO2 to dissolved alkaline bicarbonates and carbonates enables carbon sequestration. This is a long-term carbon storage which also helps against ocean acidification by increasing the ocean alkalinity.71,75,78,112 However, further research is required for understanding the full range and capacity of such approach.\n",
      "The main bottlenecks in using in situ BPMED for this mineral crystallization are the risk of membrane contamination (i.e., fouling) in the stack and the slow kinetics of the carbonate precipitation. To avoid the fouling, pure NaCl (instead of seawater) can be used in the BPMED for NaOH and HCl production.8 The produced NaOH is then added to the seawater stream in a controlled crystallizer to initiate the precipitation. In order to improve the kinetics of the precipitation, use of a seeded crystallizer unit is suggested.107,118 Although seawater CO2 capture through mineralization is shown feasible, debates on the environmental impacts of reducing Ca2+/Mg2+ concentration of the ocean are in progress.115,119\n",

      " The tangential research paper's main findings on electrochemical CO2 capture can be useful in solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in carbon capture systems. The paper discusses the concept of pH-swing, where CO2 can be captured and recovered by shifting the pH of a working fluid between acidic and basic pH. This pH-swing can be applied electrochemically through electrolysis, bipolar membrane electrodialysis, reversible redox reactions, and capacitive deionization. By utilizing these electrochemical methods, CO2 can be captured directly from the atmosphere, ocean, and flue gas. The paper also highlights the potential for electrochemical methods to convert the captured CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels, contributing to a fully electrified circular carbon economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The significance of these findings is that electrochemical CO2 capture technologies have the potential to be more energy-efficient compared to traditional methods. The use of electrochemistry allows for precise control of the electric potential gradient, driving chemical reactions isothermally. This can result in higher energy efficiency and lower energy consumption compared to other capture methods that rely on thermal energy. Additionally, electrochemical methods can be applied to all CO2-containing streams with any concentration, making them suitable for capturing CO2 from dilute sources such as air and ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are some drawbacks demonstrated by the tangential research paper. One drawback is the currently high energy consumption of electrochemical CO2 capture technologies. The paper acknowledges that these methods are still energy-intensive compared to traditional amine-based capture methods. The cost of direct air capture using traditional technologies has been estimated to be high, ranging from $100 to $1000 per tonne of captured CO2. Another drawback is the immaturity of the technology, as most electrochemical methods are still at early stages of development.\n",

      "In summary, the tangential research paper's main findings on electrochemical CO2 capture provide valuable insights into more energy-efficient carbon capture systems. The use of pH-swing and electrochemical methods can enable direct capture of CO2 from various sources and have the potential to convert the captured CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels. However, the high energy consumption and immaturity of the technology are current drawbacks that need to be addressed for these methods to be more efficient and cost-effective.\n",

      "The tangential research paper's main findings are not directly related to carbon capture systems or the efficiency of capturing CO2. Therefore, it is unlikely that the specific findings of this paper will be directly useful in solving the key problem of improving the efficiency of carbon capture systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is important to note that the tangential research paper discusses the role of formylmethanofuran (a coenzyme involved in methanogenesis) in the reduction of carbon dioxide to methane. While this is not directly related to carbon capture, it does provide insights into the mechanisms of CO2 reduction and the use of coenzymes in such processes. These insights could potentially be applied to the design and optimization of carbon capture systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main drawback of using the tangential research paper's findings to achieve the ultimate goal is that it does not provide specific information or techniques for improving the efficiency of carbon capture systems. The paper focuses on the role of formylmethanofuran in methanogenesis, which is a different process than carbon capture. Therefore, additional research and experimentation would be needed to determine how the findings of this paper could be applied to carbon capture systems.\n",

      "Get e-AlertsAbstractThe unique catalytic, electrochemical, and oxygen storage properties of ceria and mixed ceria/titania hybrid composites were used to fabricate a new type of electrochemical enzyme biosensor. These materials provided increased analytical performance and possibilities for operation in oxygen-free conditions of an oxidase enzyme biosensor using tyrosinase as a model example. The investigation of the enzymatic reaction in the presence and absence of oxygen was first carried out using cyclic voltammetry. The results were used to identify the role of each metal oxide in the immobilization matrix and fabricate a simple amperometric tyrosinase biosensor for the detection of phenol and dopamine. The biosensor was optimized and characterized with respect to response time, detection limit, linear concentration range, sensitivity, and kinetic parameters. The detection limit for phenol was in the nanomolar range, with a detection limit of 9.0 × 10−9 M and a sensitivity of 86 mA M−1 in the presence of oxygen and of 5.6 × 10−9 M and a sensitivity of 65 mA M−1 in the absence of oxygen. The optimized biosensor also showed selective determination of the neurotransmitter dopamine with a detection limit of 3.4 × 10−8 M and a sensitivity of 14.9 mA M−1 in the presence of oxygen and of 4.2 × 10−8 M and 14.8 mA M−1 in the absence of oxygen. This strategy shows promise for increasing the sensitivity of oxidase enzyme sensors and provides opportunities for operation in oxygen limited conditions. It can also be extended for the development of other enzyme biosensors.Cited By\n",

      "The tangential research paper's main findings are related to the use of mixed ceria-based metal oxides for the fabrication of electrochemical enzyme biosensors. These materials have unique catalytic, electrochemical, and oxygen storage properties, which make them suitable for operation in oxygen-free conditions. The paper demonstrates the successful use of these materials in the development of an oxidase enzyme biosensor for the detection of phenol and dopamine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The significance of these findings for the ultimate goal of proposing a more efficient carbon capture system lies in the potential application of mixed ceria-based metal oxides in the design of a carbon capture system that is less sensitive to oxygen. The presence of oxygen in the feed stream can reduce the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system by causing oxidation of the reduced quinones. By using mixed ceria-based metal oxides, which have oxygen storage properties, it may be possible to mitigate the negative effects of oxygen and improve the efficiency of the carbon capture system.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are some drawbacks that the tangential research paper demonstrates in using mixed ceria-based metal oxides for the ultimate goal. The paper focuses on the development of an enzyme biosensor and does not directly address the use of these materials in a carbon capture system. Therefore, further research and development would be needed to adapt the findings of the paper to the specific requirements of a carbon capture system. Additionally, the paper does not provide information on the energy requirements or energy efficiency of the biosensor, so it is unclear how the energy consumption of a carbon capture system using these materials would compare to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems.\n",

      "Get e-AlertsAbstractThe unique catalytic, electrochemical, and oxygen storage properties of ceria and mixed ceria/titania hybrid composites were used to fabricate a new type of electrochemical enzyme biosensor. These materials provided increased analytical performance and possibilities for operation in oxygen-free conditions of an oxidase enzyme biosensor using tyrosinase as a model example. The investigation of the enzymatic reaction in the presence and absence of oxygen was first carried out using cyclic voltammetry. The results were used to identify the role of each metal oxide in the immobilization matrix and fabricate a simple amperometric tyrosinase biosensor for the detection of phenol and dopamine. The biosensor was optimized and characterized with respect to response time, detection limit, linear concentration range, sensitivity, and kinetic parameters. The detection limit for phenol was in the nanomolar range, with a detection limit of 9.0 × 10−9 M and a sensitivity of 86 mA M−1 in the presence of oxygen and of 5.6 × 10−9 M and a sensitivity of 65 mA M−1 in the absence of oxygen. The optimized biosensor also showed selective determination of the neurotransmitter dopamine with a detection limit of 3.4 × 10−8 M and a sensitivity of 14.9 mA M−1 in the presence of oxygen and of 4.2 × 10−8 M and 14.8 mA M−1 in the absence of oxygen. This strategy shows promise for increasing the sensitivity of oxidase enzyme sensors and provides opportunities for operation in oxygen limited conditions. It can also be extended for the development of other enzyme biosensors.Cited By\n",

      " The tangential research paper's main findings are related to the use of mixed ceria-based metal oxides for the fabrication of electrochemical enzyme biosensors. These materials have unique catalytic, electrochemical, and oxygen storage properties, which make them suitable for operation in oxygen-free conditions. The paper demonstrates the successful use of these materials in the development of an oxidase enzyme biosensor for the detection of phenol and dopamine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The significance of these findings for the ultimate goal of proposing a more efficient carbon capture system lies in the potential application of mixed ceria-based metal oxides in the design of a carbon capture system that is less sensitive to oxygen. The presence of oxygen in the feed stream can reduce the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system by causing oxidation of the reduced quinones. By using mixed ceria-based metal oxides, which have oxygen storage properties, it may be possible to mitigate the negative effects of oxygen and improve the efficiency of the carbon capture system.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are some drawbacks that the tangential research paper demonstrates in using mixed ceria-based metal oxides for the ultimate goal. The paper focuses on the development of an enzyme biosensor and does not directly address the use of these materials in a carbon capture system. Therefore, further research and development would be needed to adapt the findings of the paper to the specific requirements of a carbon capture system. Additionally, the paper does not provide information on the energy requirements or energy efficiency of the biosensor, so it is unclear how the energy consumption of a carbon capture system using these materials would compare to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems.\n",

      "Get e-AlertsAbstractConjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) are usually obtained as amorphous or semicrystalline powders. Their insolubility and nonprocessability are considered as key bottlenecks that impede CMP applications. In this study, light-emitting, nanofibrous films were fabricated by electrospinning CMP/poly(lactic acid) (PLA) mixtures. The resulting nanofibrous films show a high flexibility combined with high porosity and surface-area-to-volume ratios. The CMP-based nanofibrous films have been used as sensitive sensors in the detection of nitroaromatic and benzoquinone vapors as well as oxidizing metal ions. Moreover, 4-iodophenyl-substituted graphene sheets were used as templates for growing CMP/graphene sandwiches. The graphene-based CMP (G-CMP) sandwiches are characterized by high surface areas and aspect ratios. Furthermore, hierarchically porous two-dimensional carbon nanosheets were obtained by pyrolysis of these carbon-rich G-CMP hybrids. The resulting carbon nanomaterials show excellent supercapacitor behavior with a 48% increased capacitance if compared to porous carbons without the graphene template.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b03290.Detailed synthetic procedures and characterization data and additional experimental results for the CMPs, G-CMPs, nanofibrous films, and corresponding carbons and carbon nanosheets (PDF)cm5b03290_si_001.pdf (4.06 MB)\n",

While these findings may not directly address the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in carbon capture systems, they can still provide some useful insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the research paper demonstrates the fabrication of nanofibrous films using electrospinning techniques. This could be useful in the development of carbon capture systems by providing a method to create flexible and porous materials that can be tailored for specific applications.\n",

      "Second, the paper discusses the use of graphene templates for growing conjugated microporous polymer sandwiches. This approach could potentially be applied to the design of carbon capture materials, allowing for the incorporation of graphene or other nanomaterials to enhance the performance and efficiency of the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is important to note that the tangential research paper does not directly address the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in carbon capture systems. Therefore, it does not provide specific solutions or insights into how to avoid reactions with oxygen. This limitation is a drawback of using the main findings of the tangential research paper to solve the key problem.\n",

      "Get e-AlertsAbstractConjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) are usually obtained as amorphous or semicrystalline powders. Their insolubility and nonprocessability are considered as key bottlenecks that impede CMP applications. In this study, light-emitting, nanofibrous films were fabricated by electrospinning CMP/poly(lactic acid) (PLA) mixtures. The resulting nanofibrous films show a high flexibility combined with high porosity and surface-area-to-volume ratios. The CMP-based nanofibrous films have been used as sensitive sensors in the detection of nitroaromatic and benzoquinone vapors as well as oxidizing metal ions. Moreover, 4-iodophenyl-substituted graphene sheets were used as templates for growing CMP/graphene sandwiches. The graphene-based CMP (G-CMP) sandwiches are characterized by high surface areas and aspect ratios. Furthermore, hierarchically porous two-dimensional carbon nanosheets were obtained by pyrolysis of these carbon-rich G-CMP hybrids. The resulting carbon nanomaterials show excellent supercapacitor behavior with a 48% increased capacitance if compared to porous carbons without the graphene template.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the ACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemmater.5b03290.Detailed synthetic procedures and characterization data and additional experimental results for the CMPs, G-CMPs, nanofibrous films, and corresponding carbons and carbon nanosheets (PDF)cm5b03290_si_001.pdf (4.06 MB)\n",

      "Get e-AlertsAbstractCurrent methods for CO2 capture and concentration (CCC) are energy intensive due to their reliance on thermal cycles, which are intrinsically Carnot limited in efficiency. In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\n",

      "The tangential research paper's main findings are significant for solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in carbon capture systems. The paper demonstrates a novel approach using quinones and alcohol additives to achieve oxygen-stable electrochemical CO2 capture and concentration (eCCC). This is important because most existing eCCC systems are sensitive to oxygen, which reduces their overall efficiency. By anodically shifting the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier using alcohol additives, the researchers were able to confer oxygen stability to the system. They found that ethanol was the optimal additive, as it improved both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant of the quinone redox carrier.\n",

      "These findings can be useful in solving the key problem by providing a new strategy for designing more efficient carbon capture systems. By incorporating quinones and ethanol additives, it may be possible to develop a carbon capture system that is more efficient than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured. The paper also highlights the general applicability of using hydrogen-bond donor additives to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the tangential research paper also demonstrates some drawbacks of using the main findings to achieve the ultimate goal. One drawback is that the paper does not provide detailed information on the scalability and cost-effectiveness of the proposed system. Additionally, the paper focuses on the electrochemical aspect of carbon capture and does not address other important considerations such as the capture efficiency, CO2 storage, and utilization of the captured CO2. These factors need to be taken into account when designing a carbon capture system that is more efficient than the SOTA.\n",

      "REVIEW\n",
      " The tangential research paper's main findings are significant for solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in carbon capture systems. The paper demonstrates a novel approach using quinones and alcohol additives to achieve oxygen-stable electrochemical CO2 capture and concentration (eCCC). This is important because most existing eCCC systems are sensitive to oxygen, which reduces their overall efficiency. By anodically shifting the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier using alcohol additives, the researchers were able to confer oxygen stability to the system. They found that ethanol was the optimal additive, as it improved both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant of the quinone redox carrier.\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings can be useful in solving the key problem by providing a new strategy for designing more efficient carbon capture systems. By incorporating quinones and ethanol additives, it may be possible to develop a carbon capture system that is more efficient than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured. The paper also highlights the general applicability of using hydrogen-bond donor additives to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the tangential research paper also demonstrates some drawbacks of using the main findings to achieve the ultimate goal. One drawback is that the paper does not provide detailed information on the scalability and cost-effectiveness of the proposed system. Additionally, the paper focuses on the electrochemical aspect of carbon capture and does not address other important considerations such as the capture efficiency, CO2 storage, and utilization of the captured CO2. These factors need to be taken into account when designing a carbon capture system that is more efficient than the SOTA.\n",

      "The tangential research paper's main findings on the oxygen uptake by gallic acid can be useful in solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in the carbon capture system. The paper demonstrates the reactivity of gallic acid with oxygen, which can help in understanding the oxidation reactions that occur in the carbon capture system. This knowledge can be applied to develop strategies to minimize the oxidation of the reduced quinones in the carbon capture system, thereby improving its overall efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are some drawbacks to using the main findings of the tangential research paper to achieve the ultimate goal of proposing a more efficient carbon capture system. Firstly, the research paper focuses on gallic acid, which may not be directly applicable to the carbon capture system. Secondly, the paper does not provide specific information on the electron density of the quinone polymer or how it can be tuned to avoid reactions with oxygen. Therefore, further research and experimentation would be needed to apply the findings of the tangential research paper to the carbon capture system.\n",

Secondly, the paper does not provide specific information on the electron density of the quinone polymer or how it can be tuned to avoid reactions with oxygen. Therefore, further research and experimentation would be needed to apply the findings of the tangential research paper to the carbon capture system.\n",

Partially purified preparations of tobacco-leaf o-diphenol oxidase (o-quinol–oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1.10.3.1) oxidize chlorogenic acid to brown products, absorbing, on average, 1·6atoms of oxygen/mol. oxidized, and evolving a little carbon dioxide. 2. The effect of benzenesulphinic acid on the oxidation suggests that the first stage is the formation of a quinone; the solution does not go brown, oxygen uptake is restricted to 1 atom/mol. oxidized, and a compound is produced whose composition corresponds to that of a sulphone of the quinone derived from chlorogenic acid. 3. Several other compounds that react with quinones affect the oxidation of chlorogenic acid. The colour of the products formed and the oxygen absorbed in their formation suggest that the quinone formed in the oxidation reacts with these compounds in the same way as do simpler quinones. 4. Some compounds that are often used to prevent the oxidation of polyphenols were tested to see if they act by inhibiting o-diphenol oxidase, by reacting with quinone intermediates, or both. 5. Ascorbate inhibits the enzyme and also reduces the quinone. 6. Potassium ethyl xanthate, diethyldithiocarbamate and cysteine inhibit the enzyme to different extents, and also react with the quinone. The nature of the reaction depends on the relative concentrations of inhibitor and chlorogenic acid. Excess of inhibitor prevents the solution from turning brown and restricts oxygen uptake to 1 atom/mol. of chlorogenic acid oxidized; smaller amounts do not prevent browning and slightly increase oxygen uptake. 7. 2-Mercaptobenzothiazole inhibits the enzyme, and also probably reacts with the quinone; inhibited enzyme is reactivated as if the inhibitor is removed as traces of quinone are produced. 8. Thioglycollate and polyvinylpyrrolidone inhibit the enzyme. Thioglycollate probably reduces the quinone to a small extent.Full textFull text is available as a scanned copy of the original print version.

      "The main findings of the tangential research paper can be useful in solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in carbon capture systems. The paper demonstrates that the quinone formed in the oxidation of chlorogenic acid reacts with various compounds in a specific manner. This knowledge can be applied to design a carbon capture system that minimizes the negative effects of oxygen by carefully tuning the electron density of the quinone polymer. By understanding the reactions of quinones with other compounds, it may be possible to develop strategies to prevent or mitigate the oxidation of reduced quinones in the presence of oxygen.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are some drawbacks to using the main findings of the tangential research paper to achieve the ultimate goal of a more efficient carbon capture system. Firstly, the paper does not directly address carbon capture systems, so there may be limitations in directly applying the findings to this specific context. Additionally, the paper focuses on the oxidation of chlorogenic acid and the behavior of quinones in that specific reaction. The applicability of these findings to other carbon capture processes and quinone polymers may need further investigation. Finally, the paper does not provide quantitative data on the efficiency of the reactions or the energy requirements, so it is difficult to assess the potential improvement in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured.\n",

      " The tangential research paper's main findings are focused on the enzymic oxidation of chlorogenic acid and the reactions of the quinone produced. While the paper does not directly address carbon capture systems, it provides insights into the behavior of quinones and their reactions with other compounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main findings of the tangential research paper can be useful in solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in carbon capture systems. The paper demonstrates that the quinone formed in the oxidation of chlorogenic acid reacts with various compounds in a specific manner. This knowledge can be applied to design a carbon capture system that minimizes the negative effects of oxygen by carefully tuning the electron density of the quinone polymer. By understanding the reactions of quinones with other compounds, it may be possible to develop strategies to prevent or mitigate the oxidation of reduced quinones in the presence of oxygen.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are some drawbacks to using the main findings of the tangential research paper to achieve the ultimate goal of a more efficient carbon capture system. Firstly, the paper does not directly address carbon capture systems, so there may be limitations in directly applying the findings to this specific context. Additionally, the paper focuses on the oxidation of chlorogenic acid and the behavior of quinones in that specific reaction. The applicability of these findings to other carbon capture processes and quinone polymers may need further investigation. Finally, the paper does not provide quantitative data on the efficiency of the reactions or the energy requirements, so it is difficult to assess the potential improvement in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured.\n"

      "The tangential research paper's main findings provide an overview of different technologies for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture from the air, including absorption and adsorption. The paper highlights the advantages and disadvantages of each technology and emphasizes the need for more efforts to develop direct air capture (DAC) at a large scale by reducing costs and improving efficiency.\n",

      "In terms of the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen, the paper does not specifically address this issue. However, it does mention that careful tuning of the electron density of the quinone polymer is required to avoid reactions with oxygen. This suggests that the research paper's findings may not directly address the sensitivity to oxygen in carbon capture systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main drawback demonstrated by the tangential research paper is the high energy requirement for the absorption process, especially for the calcination step in the Ca(OH)2-based process. The paper also mentions the low adsorption capacity of physisorbents due to the dilute concentration of CO2 in the air and the negative effect of moisture. Additionally, the high cost of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) makes their use in DAC prohibitive.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while the tangential research paper provides valuable insights into different carbon capture technologies, it does not directly address the sensitivity to oxygen or propose a more efficient system in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured. Further research and development are needed to address these challenges and achieve the ultimate goal.\n",
      "The tangential research paper presents a continuous electrochemical carbon capture system that couples oxygen/water redox reactions with a solid-electrolyte reactor. The system efficiently absorbs dilute CO2 molecules at the cathode-membrane interface, forms carbonate ions, and continuously outputs a high-purity CO2 stream. The main findings of the paper demonstrate high carbon-capture rates, high Faradaic efficiencies, high carbon-removal efficiency, and low energy consumption. The system does not require chemical inputs or generate side products during the carbon absorption/release process.\n",

      "These findings are significant because they provide a promising approach to carbon capture that addresses the limitations of other methods, such as low capture rates, oxygen sensitivity, and energy-intensive processes. The continuous electrochemical carbon capture system demonstrated in the paper offers high efficiency, decentralized operation, and the ability to use renewable electricity.\n",

      "The main drawback demonstrated in the tangential research paper is the sensitivity of the system to oxygen in the feed stream. The presence of oxygen can reduce the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system and requires careful tuning of the electron density of the quinone polymer to avoid reactions with oxygen. This sensitivity to oxygen limits the system's effectiveness in capturing CO2 in the presence of oxygen.\n",

      "To achieve the ultimate goal of proposing a carbon capture system more efficient than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured, the tangential research paper's main findings can be useful. The continuous electrochemical carbon capture system demonstrated in the paper offers high carbon-capture rates, high Faradaic efficiencies, and low energy consumption. These findings can be used as a starting point for developing a more efficient carbon capture system by further optimizing the system's design, materials, and operating conditions. Additionally, the use of different redox couples and catalysts, as mentioned in the paper, can be explored to improve the system's efficiency and address the sensitivity to oxygen.\n",
      "The tangential research paper's main findings on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes can be useful in solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in a carbon capture system. The paper discusses the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers, which can enhance the kinetics of electrode processes. This means that by using conducting polymers as catalysts in a carbon capture system, the overall efficiency of the system can be improved.\n",

      "Specifically, the paper mentions the use of conducting polymer electrodes modified with dispersed metals, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes. These modifications can further enhance the electrocatalytic properties of the conducting polymers, leading to even higher efficiency in capturing CO2.\n",

      "However, the main drawback demonstrated by the tangential research paper is that it does not specifically address the issue of carbon capture. While it provides valuable insights into the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers, it does not directly demonstrate their effectiveness in capturing CO2. Therefore, further research and experimentation would be needed to determine the specific application of conducting polymers in a carbon capture system and to evaluate their efficiency in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured.\n",
      "The tangential research paper's main findings demonstrate the feasibility of using salt-concentrated aqueous electrolytes for quinone-mediated electrochemical carbon capture. This electrolyte formulation offers several advantages for achieving the ultimate goal of a more efficient carbon capture system:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Compatibility with quinone electrochemistry: The electrolyte allows for the electrochemical reduction of quinones and the subsequent capture of CO2, enabling efficient carbon capture.\n",

      "2. Minimized competing reactions: The salt-concentrated electrolyte suppresses protonation and ion association reactions, which are major competing reactions that reduce the efficiency of carbon capture in aqueous solutions.\n",

The presence of oxygen can reduce the overall efficiency of the system by causing oxidation of the reduced quinones. Therefore, the main drawback of using the tangential research paper's findings to achieve the ultimate goal is the lack of information on how the electrolyte formulation addresses the sensitivity to oxygen. Further research and development would be needed to address this issue and ensure the efficient operation of the carbon capture system in the presence of oxygen.\n",

The paper presents an electrochemically mediated direct air capture (DAC) system that utilizes redox-active quinone moieties to capture and release CO2. The system relies solely on the electrochemical voltage for CO2 capture and release, eliminating the need for temperature or pH swing. The paper demonstrates the design and operation of a DAC system using stackable bipolar cells with poly(vinylanthraquinone) (PVAQ) negative electrodes. The system achieves CO2 capture from feed concentrations as low as 400 ppm and demonstrates energy consumption as low as 113 kJ per mole of CO2 captured. The bipolar cell design is modular and expandable, making it suitable for small and large-scale plants.\n",

      "The tangential research paper's main findings can be useful in solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in carbon capture systems. The paper demonstrates the use of quinone polymers for CO2 capture, which can be carefully tuned to avoid reactions with oxygen. By utilizing the electrochemical voltage for CO2 capture and release, the system can operate without the presence of oxygen, reducing the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the tangential research paper also demonstrates some drawbacks in using the main findings to achieve the ultimate goal. The paper highlights the mass transfer limitations within the electrolyte and across the gas-liquid interface, which can impact the capture and release rates of CO2. Additionally, the paper does not address the scalability and cost-effectiveness of the proposed system, which are important considerations for real-world implementation.\n",

      "In summary, the tangential research paper's main findings provide valuable insights into the use of quinone polymers and electrochemical methods for carbon capture. The findings can help address the sensitivity to oxygen in carbon capture systems. However, further research is needed to overcome mass transfer limitations and address scalability and cost-effectiveness for practical implementation.\n",
      "The tangential research paper's main findings are significant because they explore the use of electrochemical carbon capture and concentration (eCCC) systems as a promising alternative to thermally-driven carbon capture methods. The paper discusses different approaches, such as pH-mediated systems using redox mediators like quinones, phenazines, redox-active amines, and inorganic compounds. These systems offer the potential for higher energetic efficiencies and lower energy requirements compared to current carbon capture technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The tangential research paper demonstrates that eCCC systems, particularly those using pH-mediated approaches with redox mediators, can capture and release carbon dioxide with high Faradaic efficiencies. The use of redox mediators allows for pH swings that facilitate CO2 capture and release, and these systems can operate at or near room temperature. The paper also highlights the potential for modular designs and the use of low-carbon energy sources, making eCCC systems more attractive for large-scale deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "One drawback demonstrated by the tangential research paper is the limited solubility and stability of some redox mediators, such as quinones, in aqueous solutions. This can restrict the concentration of the mediator and the quantity of CO2 that can be separated in each cell. Additionally, some redox mediators may exhibit low long-term stability, limiting their practicality for continuous operation. Further research is needed to optimize the stability, solubility, and performance of redox mediators in eCCC systems.\n",

      "In summary, the tangential research paper's main findings demonstrate the potential of eCCC systems, particularly those using pH-mediated approaches with redox mediators, to achieve higher energetic efficiencies and lower energy requirements for carbon capture. However, challenges related to mediator solubility, stability, and long-term performance need to be addressed for practical implementation.\n",
      "The tangential research paper's main findings on electrochemical CO2 capture can be useful in solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in carbon capture systems. The paper discusses the concept of pH-swing, where CO2 can be captured and recovered by shifting the pH of a working fluid between acidic and basic pH. This pH-swing can be applied electrochemically through electrolysis, bipolar membrane electrodialysis, reversible redox reactions, and capacitive deionization. By utilizing these electrochemical methods, CO2 can be captured directly from the atmosphere, ocean, and flue gas. The paper also highlights the potential for electrochemical methods to convert the captured CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels, contributing to a fully electrified circular carbon economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The significance of these findings is that electrochemical CO2 capture technologies have the potential to be more energy-efficient compared to traditional methods. The use of electrochemistry allows for precise control of the electric potential gradient, driving chemical reactions isothermally. This can result in higher energy efficiency and lower energy consumption compared to other capture methods that rely on thermal energy. Additionally, electrochemical methods can be applied to all CO2-containing streams with any concentration, making them suitable for capturing CO2 from dilute sources such as air and ocean.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there are some drawbacks demonstrated by the tangential research paper. One drawback is the currently high energy consumption of electrochemical CO2 capture technologies. The paper acknowledges that these methods are still energy-intensive compared to traditional amine-based capture methods. The cost of direct air capture using traditional technologies has been estimated to be high, ranging from $100 to $1000 per tonne of captured CO2. Another drawback is the immaturity of the technology, as most electrochemical methods are still at early stages of development.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the tangential research paper's main findings on electrochemical CO2 capture provide valuable insights into more energy-efficient carbon capture systems. The use of pH-swing and electrochemical methods can enable direct capture of CO2 from various sources and have the potential to convert the captured CO2 into value-added chemicals and fuels. However, the high energy consumption and immaturity of the technology are current drawbacks that need to be addressed for these methods to be more efficient and cost-effective.\n",
      "The tangential research paper's main findings are related to electrochemical and electrocatalytic reactions of carbon dioxide. These findings can be significant in solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in a carbon capture system. \n",
      "\n",
      "One possible way the tangential research paper's findings can be useful is by exploring electrochemical methods for carbon capture. Electrochemical reactions have the potential to capture and convert carbon dioxide into useful products, such as fuels or chemicals. By utilizing electrocatalysts, the efficiency of the carbon capture system can be improved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the research paper may provide insights into the design and optimization of quinone polymers. Quinone polymers are known for their ability to capture carbon dioxide, but they are sensitive to oxygen. The research paper may offer strategies for tuning the electron density of the quinone polymer to minimize reactions with oxygen, thus improving the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the tangential research paper may also demonstrate some drawbacks in using its main findings to achieve the ultimate goal. For example, it may highlight challenges in scaling up electrochemical carbon capture systems or limitations in the stability and durability of electrocatalysts. These drawbacks need to be carefully considered and addressed to ensure the feasibility and practicality of implementing the research paper's findings in a more efficient carbon capture system.\n",
      "Thoughts on the significance of the tangential research paper's main findings and how different parts might be useful to achieve the goal:\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, the tangential research paper does not provide any information or findings that can be directly used to solve the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in a carbon capture system.

While this is not directly related to carbon capture, it does provide insights into the mechanisms of CO2 reduction and the use of coenzymes in such processes. These insights could potentially be applied to the design and optimization of carbon capture systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main drawback of using the tangential research paper's findings to achieve the ultimate goal is that it does not provide specific information or techniques for improving the efficiency of carbon capture systems. The paper focuses on the role of formylmethanofuran in methanogenesis, which is a different process than carbon capture. Therefore, additional research and experimentation would be needed to determine how the findings of this paper could be applied to carbon capture systems.\n",
      "The tangential research paper's main findings are related to the use of mixed ceria-based metal oxides for the fabrication of electrochemical enzyme biosensors. These materials have unique catalytic, electrochemical, and oxygen storage properties, which make them suitable for operation in oxygen-free conditions. The paper demonstrates the successful use of these materials in the development of an oxidase enzyme biosensor for the detection of phenol and dopamine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The significance of these findings for the ultimate goal of proposing a more efficient carbon capture system lies in the potential application of mixed ceria-based metal oxides in the design of a carbon capture system that is less sensitive to oxygen. The presence of oxygen in the feed stream can reduce the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system by causing oxidation of the reduced quinones. By using mixed ceria-based metal oxides, which have oxygen storage properties, it may be possible to mitigate the negative effects of oxygen and improve the efficiency of the carbon capture system.\n",

Therefore, further research and development would be needed to adapt the findings of the paper to the specific requirements of a carbon capture system. Additionally, the paper does not provide information on the energy requirements or energy efficiency of the biosensor, so it is unclear how the energy consumption of a carbon capture system using these materials would compare to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems.\n",

      "The tangential research paper's main findings are significant for solving the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in carbon capture systems. The paper demonstrates a novel approach using quinones and alcohol additives to achieve oxygen-stable electrochemical CO2 capture and concentration (eCCC). This is important because most existing eCCC systems are sensitive to oxygen, which reduces their overall efficiency. By anodically shifting the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier using alcohol additives, the researchers were able to confer oxygen stability to the system. They found that ethanol was the optimal additive, as it improved both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant of the quinone redox carrier.\n",
