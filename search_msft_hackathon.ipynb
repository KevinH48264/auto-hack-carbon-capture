      "Broader context\n",
      "There is a clear scientific consensus on the role of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the unusually wild fluctuations of global climate patterns over the last century, to which carbon dioxide is the largest contributor. This has generated a scientific tide in the study of carbon removal techniques over the last three decades, which has slowly gathered momentum, culminating in the 2015 Paris Agreement, which heavily emphasized the role of carbon removal by tackling emissions or via negative emissions technologies. While a path forward for carbon capture is being shaped by a mix of incumbent actors and newcomers, the great majority of the proposed processes rely on conventional concepts. Moreover, most of these processes have a large balance of plant which hinders their potential to flexibly adapt to the multi-scale nature of carbon capture. Herein, we demonstrate a new approach which presents a paradigm shift in adsorption type processes and carbon capture. The electro-swing basis of our process allows its linear scaling with desired capacity and lends it geometric flexibility. It also allows carbon capture from streams of any concentration, and its release into any carrier streams, including pure CO2, with a low balance of plant.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "With the alarming increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and its implications for global climate pattern developments,1,2 mitigation of climate change through curtailment of anthropogenic CO2 emissions has been one of the most urgent socioeconomic and scientific problems in the global arena over the last decade.3 To this end, a number of technologies have been developed for the large-scale capture of CO2 from combustion and other industrial processes to produce high-purity CO2 streams for storage or valorization.4 The most mature of these technologies are solvent scrubbing, mainly amine scrubbing,5 and oxyfuel combustion,6 which target high CO2 concentration streams (>10%). These approaches have a large footprint and, when retrofitted to a process, can require major modifications to the plant. Consequently, there has been a major effort to develop new materials and processes for high efficiency CO2-capture, including sorbents for pressure and temperature swing adsorption systems,7 and membranes for selective transport of the CO2.8 Furthermore, many potential applications of carbon capture require compact devices due to space limitations, such as in the direct capture of CO2 from tailpipe exhausts on board mobile sources, in which there is growing interest given the large contribution of transportation exhaust to greenhouse gas emissions (33.5% of U.S. CO2 emissions in 2016).9\n",
      "In addition to the capture of CO2 from direct combustion processes, there is a need to remove CO2 from enclosed spaces for ventilation purposes in buildings and car cabins, or for cabin environmental control systems on board spacecraft and submarines, where the maximum allowed CO2 concentration in habitable spaces is 5000 ppm (or 0.5%).10 The first of such systems was developed by Winnick et al., for the electrochemical capture of CO2 in spacecraft cabins using molten carbonates.11 However, the low concentration of CO2 in such applications poses a challenge, mainly due to the low driving forces for mass transfer and the large quantities of other species present in air in addition to CO2.12 Thus, carbon capture is a multi-scale problem, where the CO2-rich streams to be treated vary greatly in volume, concentration and composition, and different criteria need to be fulfilled to ensure optimal processing depending on whether sources are industrial or small-scale (e.g., power plants or oil and gas heaters), concentrated or dilute (exhausts from combustion or air in confined spaces), and clean or contaminated with other pollutants.\n",
      "Many of the CO2-capture chemical processes that involve a capture agent such as amines or solid sorbents require temperature and/or pressure swings to release the captured CO2 and regenerate the agents for further capture. These swings result in inefficiencies due to energy wasted in heating solvents and sorbents, pressurizing feed gas, or drawing a vacuum for desorption. Electrochemical systems can minimize such parasitic energy losses as they can be operated at near isothermal conditions, with significantly higher efficiencies than their thermal-swing (TSA) and pressure-swing (PSA) adsorption counterparts.13 One mode of electrochemical capture of CO2 is through the use of a redox-active carrier.\n",
      "Electrochemically mediated selective transport of chemical species was first reported by Ward et al.,14 where a redox-active carrier (ferrous ion) was used to transport nitric oxide across a membrane. Since then, a number of systems have been developed for transporting chemical species by redox-active carriers that are activated at one electrode, to bind with the target species, and deactivated at the opposite electrode, to release the target and regenerate the carrier.15,16 Systems that have been proposed for the concentration of CO2 through this approach have been based on a number of different carrier molecules, such as quinones,17â€“20 4,4â€²-bipyridine,21 and thiolates.22,23 Quinones are of particular interest to this work for their superior electrochemical performance, serving as redox-active carriers for CO2 in electrochemically mediated separation processes. DuBois et al. demonstrated this possibility, and studied the thermodynamics of an electrochemical CO2 pumping system that utilizes quinones.18 More work followed, where Scovazzo et al. demonstrated the electrochemical separation of CO2 from <1% concentration gas mixtures using 2,6-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone as a carrier in ionic liquid (IL) and organic solvent electrolytes media,19 while Gurkan et al. screened a number of ILs to serve as suitable electrolytes for quinone carriers in an electrochemically mediated selective transport system for CO2.20 All of these systems, however, require the transport of the electrolyte and the dissolved carrier molecules between two electrodes in an electrochemical cell for capture and release of CO2. This limits their implementation in a number of applications where the requirement for flow systems and pumping, and the large footprint, are problematic.\n",
      "In this work, we develop a compact electrochemical device for CO2 capture that eliminates the requirement for complex flow systems, and that can be effective in the treatment of both high and low concentration feed streams. A quinone-utilizing faradaic electrochemical cell that fulfils these requirements and operates as an Electro-Swing Adsorption (ESA) process is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. The cell is comprised of two cathode electrode substrates coated with a CO2-binding quinoneâ€“carbon nanotube (Qâ€“CNT) composite sandwiching an anode electrode substrate coated with a ferroceneâ€“CNT (Fcâ€“CNT) composite, with separator membranes between the electrodes. This cell architecture is employed to maximize the CO2-binding surface area of the cell exposed to gas flow in a parallel passage adsorbent contactor design where stacks of these cells form parallel gas channels. The Fcâ€“CNT electrode serves as an electron source and sink for the reduction and oxidation, respectively, of the Qâ€“CNT electrodes to regulate the uptake and release of the CO2. Wetting of porous non-woven carbon fiber mats used as the electrode substrates by a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) electrolyte enables effective ionic currents to pass through the electrolyte on activation and deactivation of the electrodes, and permits the diffusion of CO2 into the electrolyte-wetted cathodes during capture.\n",
      "Fig. 1\n",
      "Schematic of a single electro-swing adsorption electrochemical cell with porous electrodes and electrolyte separators. The outer electrodes, coated with poly-1,4-anthraquinone composite, can capture CO2 on application of a reducing potential via carboxylation of quinone, and release the CO2 on reversal of the polarity. The inner polyvinylferrocene-containing electrode serves as an electron source and sink for the quinone reduction and oxidation, respectively.\n",
      "The effectiveness of the electro-swing concept for CO2 capture and release was demonstrated in a sealed system in which cell polarity was cycled to regulate the activation and deactivation of the carrier, i.e. reduction and oxidation of the redox active quinone. This was in lieu of the advection of the carrier electrolyte solution between two electrodes with a difference in potential.19 The performance of flow-through modules constructed with stacks of the assembled electrode cells was also assessed. The CO2 capture processes were modelled to provide greater insight into the operational principles for this technology.\n",
      "Ultimately, the goal of this work was to demonstrate an electrochemically activated packed parallel passage contactor adsorption system for the removal of CO2 from flue gas and other CO2-rich streams. The regeneration of the bed takes place on reversal of the polarity of the stack in an ESA, with analogies to PSA systems, where adsorption takes place at high pressure and desorption at a lower pressure,24 or TSA systems, where adsorption takes place at low temperatures and the fixed bed is regenerated at higher temperatures.25\n",
      "Results and discussion\n",
      "Design of the electrochemical cell\n",
      "Thin films of crystallized organic compounds have been studied as a means of immobilizing CO2 redox-active carriers onto electrode substrates.26 Redox-active polymers have long been the preferred electrode material when using organic molecules in electrochemical cells, however, because polymers are less soluble in the electrolyte than their corresponding redox-active repeating units, and thus the self-discharge of the cell can be avoided, and its cycling performance improved.27 For example, quinone polymers have been investigated as suitable cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries,28 and pseudocapacitive energy storage devices.29 These polymers are usually made into composites with conductive high-surface area carbon materials, such as carbon black, graphite or carbon nanotubes (CNT), to enhance the overall conductivity of the electrode material and increase the area of the polymer exposed to the electrolyte.30 Here, we used a polyanthraquinoneâ€“CNT (PAQâ€“CNT) composite for the cathode and polyvinylferroceneâ€“CNT (PVFcâ€“CNT) composite for the anode.31 The electrolyte used was the RTIL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bmim][TF2N]), selected for its low volatility, which allows for flow of gas over the wetted electrodes without loss of electrolyte to evaporation or entrainment.\n",
      "A sealed chamber was constructed in which CO2 capture and release on electrochemical activation and deactivation of the quinones, respectively, was indicated by the concomitant pressure changes in the chamber. A flow cell was also fabricated to house stacks of the electrochemical cells to allow for capture of CO2 from flowing gas streams of compositions similar to those of flue gases, air in aircraft cabins and buildings, and in the ambient environment. The adsorption effectiveness was assessed through analysis of the breakthrough profiles.\n",
      "The chemical specificity of quinones can provide near 100% purity of released CO2, which, when combined with a well-designed process in which 100% CO2 recovery is achieved, puts the technology much closer to the upper-right corner on the recovery-purity Pareto plot than those based on current CO2 sorbents.32,33\n",
      "Polyanthraquinone electrodes.\n",
      "Poly(1,4-anthraquinone) (P14AQ), shown in Fig. 1, was synthesized and incorporated into an ink with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Non-woven carbon fiber mat electrode substrates of thickness 150 Î¼m (35 g mâˆ’2) were dip-coated in the ink and dried very slowly to obtain a composite that uniformly coated the substrate at âˆ¼1.2 mg cmâˆ’2, shown in Fig. 2(a). The composite structure allows for a greater utilization of the anthraquinone repeating units in the polymers, and thus larger currents under applied potentials. The CNT mesh, shown in Fig. 2(f), provides a backbone to improve the conductivity of the conjugated PAQ via Ï€â€“Ï€ interactions with the anthraquinone units (Fig. S3, ESIâ€ ); it also provides a porous matrix decorated by the polymer chains for better electrolyte penetration. This results in a larger surface area of the polymer being exposed to electrolyte, and an increased conductivity in the composite.34 The Ï€â€“Ï€ interaction of the polymer chains and CNTs, and the subsequent decoration of the nanotubes with the polymer chains, shown in Fig. 2(e), also improved the suspension of the CNTs in the polymer solution, which resulted in very well dispersed inks. The ratio of PAQ to CNT was optimized, with the highest current per mass of active material (polymer) obtained at a 1:3, PAQ:CNT ratio by weight (Fig. S4, ESIâ€ ). The cyclic voltammograms in Fig. 3 shown in green (under N2) and red (under CO2) indicate the strong redox activity of these electrode surfaces; the differences in the current response following potential scans are discussed later.\n",

Therefore, the anode electrode material for the electrochemical cell with PAQâ€“CNT cathode was a composite of polyvinylferrocene and CNT (PVFcâ€“CNT), shown in Fig. 1. This was prepared by dispersing MWCNTs in a solution of PVFc in NMP. The optimum ratio of the composite was found to be 1:1, PVFc:CNT, by weight. The electrode substrate was dip-coated in the ink and dried slowly to yield a composite that uniformly coated the substrate at âˆ¼1.4 mg cmâˆ’2, as shown in Fig. 4. The CVs of the PVFcâ€“CNT electrode in N2 and CO2 saturated [Bmim][TF2N] are identical, and are indicated by the blue line in Fig. 3.

      "The electrochemical cell.\n",
      "The PAQâ€“CNT electrodes were assembled into an electrochemical cell in which CO2 was able to be captured and released upon potential swings. This was accomplished by layering a PVFcâ€“CNT counter electrode between the two PAQâ€“CNT electrodes to balance the charge of these electrodes, as shown in Fig. 5(d). In a CO2-rich environment, this afforded a polymer-based battery with an electrochemical window of âˆ¼1.2 V, where all the charge from the ferrocene oxidation, at its reduction potential, was balanced by the charge transferred to the two-electron reduction of quinone, at its first reduction potential. This window is defined by the reduction potential of PVFcâ€“CNT and the first reduction potential of PAQâ€“CNT, shown in Fig. 3 as Î”V1. However, in the absence of CO2 or other such electrophiles, mainly under N2, PAQ retains its two one-electron reductions, with half of the charge of the ferrocene oxidation being balanced by the reduction of quinone at the first potential and the other half by its reduction at the second potential. This results in a wider electrochemical window, shown in Fig. 3 as Î”V2, and the behavior of the cell resembles that of an asymmetric pseudocapacitor.35\n",

      "The capacities of the anode and cathodes of the cell, evaluated by gravimetric charge calibration of the two electrode composite materials (Fig. S5, ESIâ€ ), were balanced by requiring that mP14AQâ€“CNT = 1.12mPFVcâ€“CNT, which allowed for some excess PVFcâ€“CNT.\n",
      "Carbon capture\n",
      "Two different types of units were fabricated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the electro-swing process. The first was a sealed chamber into which the electrodes were inserted. Changes in pressure were measured as CO2 was adsorbed and then released on cycling of the potential applied to the electrodes. The second approach used a flow adsorption in which the CO2 exiting the device was monitored, with the breakthrough point reflecting the overall capacity of the electrodes. All carbon capture experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "CO2 capture and release in a batch system.\n",
      "An electrochemical cell (4 cm2 of total exposed area) with the three layers, such as that illustrated in Fig. 1, was tested for the capture and release of CO2 in a sealed chamber, shown in Fig. 5. This cell had âˆ¼4.8 mg of PAQâ€“CNT deposited, i.e. 5.8 Î¼mol of quinone, or a capacity for 11.6 Î¼mol of CO2. From the monitored pressure changes in the chamber of known internal void volume, the number of moles of CO2 captured and released upon charge and discharge of the cell at constant potentials, were calculated. The chamber was purged with CO2 at the desired concentrations and sealed at atmospheric pressure. The pressure inside was allowed to equilibrate at constant temperature before the electrochemical experiments were started.\n",
      "The performance of the electrochemical cell was evaluated in chronoamperometric (potentiostatic) experiments, with capture at 1.3 V and release at 0.5 V, i.e. Î”V = 0.8 V. Fig. 6(a) shows the change in the number of moles of CO2 captured from pure gas over 10 cycles (blue), along with the charge transferred to and from the cell (red). It shows that âˆ¼65% of the quinone units were utilized, i.e. 7.4 Î¼mol of CO2 captured. This may be due to incomplete charging of the quinones that are not exposed to electrolyte. From the charge transferred during charging and discharge (âˆ¼800 mC), and the moles of CO2 captured and released, a faradaic efficiencyÂ (1)of up to 90% was estimated, with some of the charge lost to double layer charging of the porous electrodes. Here, F is Faraday's constant, Q is the charge transferred, and n is the number of moles of useful electrons transferred in the reaction, i.e. used for the capture of CO2, which in this reaction, is equivalent to the number of moles of CO2. This efficiency results in âˆ¼86 kJ per mole of CO2 captured and released, as determined by the relationÂ (2)where Î”V is the difference between the applied charge and discharge potentials.\n",

(b) The CO2 captured under different feed concentrations. (c) Capacity of cell over 7000 cycles. In a different set of experiments using a larger cell and cavity, (d) shows the effect of varying charging potential for a 1000 s capture and (e) shows the effect of varying the capture duration at âˆ’1.8 V capture potential. These experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "Fig. 6(b) shows similar results for the capture of CO2 from gases of different concentrations ranging between 15 and 100%. Again, quinone utilization was high, but dependent on the initial gas concentration, owing not to capacity limitations, but to a reduction on sorption dynamics due to mass transfer limitations with lower concentration driving forces. The electrochemical cell showed great stability with <30% loss in capacity over 7000 cycles of capture and release, Fig. 6(c). The gradual loss in capacity is mainly due to the electromigration of the shorter polymer chains, Fig. S1 (ESIâ€ ), from the electrode and into the electrolyte, towards the opposite electrode.\n",
      "In a different set of experiments where a larger cell (âˆ¼450 cm2 of total exposed area) was used, CO2 transport limitations became more prominent due to the larger internal volume of the cavity used. In this set, the effect of applying an overpotential was studied, where capture potentials of greater than Î”V1 (in Fig. 3) were applied during a 1000 s capture experiment. Fig. 6(d) shows that upon increasing the applied capture potential more CO2 is captured for the duration of the experiment, which indicates the activation of more quinone units on the electrodes during the charging half-cycle. Charging the system at âˆ’1.8 V for varying durations, Fig. 6(e), shows that the system is fully charged after 2000 s, but more CO2 is captured, i.e. more of the quinones are utilized, at increasing durations of capture. This demonstrates the transport limitations of the electrodes, as explained in later sections.\n",
      "CO2 capture and release in flow systems.\n",
      "The adsorption bed assembled consisted of a few electrochemical cells stacked in the flow device to allow the flow of gas in between, as illustrated in Fig. 7(a). The blue regions indicate the presence of CO2, and the decrease in blue intensity within the channel indicates the adsorption front, ahead of which the bed is still empty, and behind which the bed, i.e. the electrode assembly, is saturated with CO2 and cannot adsorb more. A number of different cells were constructed in the flow bed configuration shown in Fig. 7(b). The exposed area of a typical cell was 18 cm Ã— 10 cm, with âˆ¼0.2 g of P14AQâ€“CNT composite; at âˆ¼70% useful quinones, this amounted to the adsorption of âˆ¼9â€“14 cm3 of CO2. The channels between the cells were typically âˆ¼500 Î¼m thick, and bed volumes were about 35 cm3 with a total bed weight of âˆ¼1.5 g bringing the productivity of the bed to 0.01â€“0.02 kg CO2 per kgbedtb, where tb is the breakthrough time, i.e. the time to reach saturation of the electrodes or for the outlet CO2 concentration to begin to increase. At feed flow rates of âˆ¼10 mL minâˆ’1 and 15% CO2, this productivity is on par with the TSA systems reported by Ntiamoah et al.36\n",

      "(a) Schematic illustration of the parallel passage electrochemical cell contactor. The blue region indicates the saturated zone and the development of the mass transfer zone. (b) Photograph of a flow bed with a stack of the electrochemical cells.\n",
      "It can be shown that axial flow dispersion within individual channels was minimal at most flow rates, and that the transport resistances resided primarily within the electrodes. Imperfect packing of the cells in the flow device by hand did, in some cases, lead to significant channeling and large-scale device axial dispersion, however, with broad breakthrough curves, but it is anticipated that under optimal manufacturing conditions these effects can be reduced significantly.\n",
      "The chronoamperometric experiments performed in the sealed system were repeated in a flow system. Mixtures of N2 and CO2 at different compositions were flown past the stack of assembled electrochemical cells. Upon reduction of the PAQâ€“CNT electrodes, CO2 was removed (captured) from the inlet stream, and the decrease in the concentration of CO2 was detected at the outlet stream. In these experiments the bed was fully activated by charging at a constant potential greater than Î”V22 to guarantee the complete reduction of the all accessible quinone units prior to adsorption. Experiments with an initial half activation, i.e., at Î”V1, followed by adsorption at constant potential, did not result in different breakthrough curves, mainly because the kinetics of the reduction and the adsorption reactions are much faster than the rates of mass transfer of CO2 into the film, as discussed later.\n",
      "The breakthrough profiles obtained for one flow system are shown in Fig. 8(a). Breakthrough was achieved at smaller bed volumes of gas treated for higher feed CO2 concentrations, where the bed volume is a time measure which represents the total volume of gas treated at any given time relative to the volume of the bed itself. The breakthrough curves superimpose when normalized by the inlet CO2 concentration, shown in Fig. 8(b), which indicates a consistent behavior of the bed, i.e. equal utilization of the overall adsorption capacity regardless of the inlet concentration, an indication of a rectangular equilibrium isotherm. Note in this particular module that, although the breakthrough curves themselves were sharp, prior to breakthrough there was a consistent effluent concentration of 20% of the feed concentration, the result of a bypassing of the active cells by 20% of the total gas flow. The overall capacity of the bed can be calculated from the area between the line at Cout/Cin = 1 and the normalized breakthrough curve. A contactor bed of a desired overall capacity can be designed by linear scaling from this overall capacity. With a larger bed, CO2 was fully captured from a stream at 10% inlet concentration, which is on the higher end for carbon capture applications as it mimics combustion exhaust. Up to 10 bed volumes of feed were treated before breakthrough was achieved, indicating capacity of greater than one bed volume of pure CO2. It has similarly been shown that complete removal of CO2 with a smaller stack of cells (a scaled down contactor), five replicate capture experiments were conducted on an inlet stream of âˆ¼0.8% CO2, Fig. 8(d), which mimics conditions for ventilation of confined living spaces, such as space modules, submarines and buildings. The breakthrough curves were unaffected by the prior history of the bed, indicating that complete regeneration and restoration of the bed capacity was attained during the desorption following each adsorption run.\n",

      "(a) Breakthrough profiles obtained at four inlet concentrations. (b) Same breakthrough profiles in (a) normalized by the inlet concentrations. (c) Breakthrough profile obtained from a large system operating at âˆ¼10% inlet concentration. (d) Breakthrough profiles obtained from five replicate runs of a smaller system operating at âˆ¼0.8% inlet concentration. These experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "The broadness of the breakthrough profiles in Fig. 8(c) and (d) can be attributed to the variation in channel width. Since the electrochemical cell stacks are hand-assembled and fitted into the bed, some variation in channel width along the same channel and the parallel channels can cause an uneven distribution of flow resulting in overlapping of multiple breakthrough profiles, which culminate in a broad overall profile. Also, mass-transfer dispersion plays a significant role in the broadness of the profiles. As is evident from the long durations for an effective capture in Fig. 6(e), and discussed later, mass transfer of CO2 into the electrodes is the rate controlling step, and this causes axial dispersion that widens the mass transfer zone in the channel, illustrated in Fig. 7(a), resulting in broad breakthrough profiles in this case.\n",
      "Mechanism of CO2 capture\n",
      "Mizen and Wrighton first demonstrated the reductive addition of CO2 to 9,10-phenanthrenequinone in aprotic electrolytes. Quinones undergo two reversible one-electron reductions in aprotic electrolytes, at two reduction potentials, as shown in Scheme 1(a) for anthraquinone. But in the presence of CO2, a single two-electron quasi-reversible reduction takes place at the first reduction potential, as shown in Scheme 1(b), where the CO2 molecule carboxylates the quinone resulting in a carbonate salt.37 Upon the first reduction of a quinone molecule, a semiquinone radical anion is produced. Some semiquinones, with sufficient electron density, i.e. sufficient Lewis base strength, can react with CO2 in a nucleophilic addition to form a carbonate salt. Semiquinones with lower electron density â€“ due to attached electron withdrawing groups â€“ do not have the nucleophilic strength to react with CO2.38 A semiquinone carboxylated by the reductive addition of CO2 has its negative charge isolated from the rest of the molecule by a Ïƒ-bond, rendering the carboxylated quinone aromatic ring(s) relatively neutral. Hence, the two-electron reduction of the parent quinone under CO2 occurs at the first reduction potential. The second reduction generates another nucleophilic center, i.e. the second oxygen of the quinone, which reacts with a second CO2 molecule to form a bis(carbonate) dianion salt â€“ the quinol dianion diadduct. A similar behavior is observed when quinones are reduced in protic electrolyte media and the reduced quinones react with protons to form two hydroxyl groups via a two-electron reduction.39\n",

      "(a) Two single-electron reduction waves of anthraquinone in the absence of electrophiles. (b) One two-electron reduction wave of anthraquinone in the presence of CO2.\n",
      "The nucleophilic addition reaction of reduced quinones occurs only with electrophiles with sufficient Lewis acidity, such as CO2, and not N2, hence the great selectivity in adsorption. Furthermore, water, in the treated gas stream, has minimal effect on carbon capture, mainly because the hydrophobicity of the IL used presents a considerable mass transfer resistance for water with very little retention,40 and any residual water in the IL phase merely stabilizes the reduced quinones,41 with no significant change to the electrochemical or chemical steps of the carbon capture process.20 While the presence of oxygen can cause the oxidation of some reduced quinones with a sufficiently negative reduction potential, through the formation of the superoxide radical anion O2Ë™âˆ’, it is possible to avoid any reactions with oxygen in the feed stream by carefully tuning the electron density of the quinone polymer.42\n",
      "The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the PAQâ€“CNT composite on the electrode substrate in [Bmim][TF2N] saturated with N2, the green line in Fig. 3, shows two redox couples corresponding to the two reduction potentials of anthraquinone. The cathodic and anodic peaks, however, are broader than those reported for solutions of quinone molecules in electrolytes,20 which can be ascribed to the slower electron exchange between differently-reduced redox units, i.e. neutral quinone, semiquinone (radical anion) and quinol dianion, along the Ï€-conjugated backbone of the polymer,43 and also to the diffusion and electromigration of electrolytic species into and out of the porous PAQâ€“CNT film.44 The expected disappearance of the second redox couple of the CV under CO2 was observed, as shown by the red line in Fig. 3, and attributed to the carboxylation of the reduced quinone units along the polymer chain facilitating the second electron reduction of anthraquinone at the first reduction potential, with the consequent increase in the current at that potential. The PAQâ€“CNT electrode can therefore be used to remove CO2 selectively from a gas mixture via nucleophilic addition, and regenerated via an electrochemical oxidation, with release of the CO2, as shown earlier. The two reduction potentials under N2 are E01 = âˆ’1.21 V and E02 = âˆ’1.63 V, vs. Fc. Under CO2 these two potentials coalesce to yield a single quasi-reversible redox couple at the first reduction potential observed under N2, i.e. E01.\n",
      "The separation of the oxidation and reduction peaks in the CVs reported is large, indicating sluggish electron transfer to the quinone repeat units on the polymer, and a thick diffusion layer in the porous electrode.44 While the ratio of polymer to CNT was optimized for the greatest gravimetric capacity, it is not the ideal ratio for conductivity. Some of the conductivity takes place through the backbone of the polymer, which contributes to the slow electron transfer. This, however, does not present a problem in the design of the contactor separation unit, since the rate limiting step in the CO2 capture process is the transport of CO2 and not electron transfer.\n",
      "The double carboxylation (CO2 addition) of anthraquinone to form the bis(carbonate) dianion follows an ECEC mechanism, as shown in Scheme 2(a). During a constant-current charging of the cell in the presence of a flux of CO2 towards the quinone units equal to, or higher than, the rate of the electrochemical reduction of the quinones, both of the reduction electrochemical reactions take place at the first reduction potential, E01. The molar flux of CO2, NCO2, towards the electrode (moles per unit area per second) should match the current density, J, at the electrode (charge per unit area per second), as in,Â (3)Conversely, if the flux of CO2 is lower than the rate of reduction, some of the semiquinones produced in the first reduction are not carboxylated but are instead reduced to quinol dianions at the more negative second potential, E02, as shown in Scheme 2(b). In this case, for the same number of moles of semiquinone being reduced, and hence electrons, i.e. charge, transferred, more energy is required in accordance with eqn (2).\n",

      "CO2 deprivation was not a problem in the highly saturated electrolyte in the CV electrochemical characterizations, where the concentration of CO2 in the electrolyte was about 20 times higher than that of the quinones on the electrode. However, in an adsorption system, where the electrolyte is not saturated with CO2 there needs to be a careful balance between the advective and diffusive fluxes of CO2 towards the anthraquinone cathodes for reductive addition, and the rate of the reduction of anthraquinone. This can be better controlled by charging the cell, i.e. reducing the anthraquinone, at a constant potential that is sufficient to drive the first reduction of anthraquinone but not the second, i.e. charging the cell at a potential difference that is between Î”V1 and Î”V2. With operation at this constant potential, the flux of CO2 does not affect the energy of binding, since the second electron is acquired by a semiquinone at the first reduction potential, but only after the first CO2 addition occurs; following this second reduction, a second CO2 molecule can bind to the dianion monoadduct. When the first reduction is allowed in a CO2-lean environment at a constant potential, the current observed after the initial surge, which results from the first reduction, is proportional to the flux of CO2 towards the anthraquinone electrode. Nevertheless, this current ultimately diminishes due to the decrease in the number of semiquinones available to react with CO2. In a CO2-rich environment, at constant potential charging, the observed current after the initial surge is proportional to the transport of CO2 into the electrode and the rate of the addition reaction which follows the nucleophilic addition mechanism between semiquinones and dissolved CO2,Â R = kCQË™âˆ’CCO2,IL(4)where R is the rate of the reaction and k is the rate constant. The electrochemical steps proceed at a faster rate than the chemical reactions, but both types of reactions have rates that are faster than the rate of diffusion of CO2 in the IL, leading to a large DamkÃ¶hler number,Â (5)where CQ is the initial concentration of anthraquinone repeat units on the electrode, CCO2 is the concentration of CO2 in the IL, L is the thickness of the IL-wetted porous electrode, which is about 150 Î¼m, and DCO2,IL is the diffusion coefficient of CO2 in the IL and is about 4 Ã— 10âˆ’10 m2 sâˆ’1. While it is the semiquinone that participates in the reaction here, the initial concentration CQ is a good approximation for estimating the order of magnitude of Da. The rate constant can be estimated to be 102 Mâˆ’1 sâˆ’1,37 resulting in Da âˆ¼104. Large values of Da indicate that mass transfer will control the process and thus the charging and subsequent carboxylation of the quinones can be assumed to be in equilibrium with the prevailing CO2 concentration at any position and at any time. Therefore, with a reduced thickness of the electrodes, the CO2 mass transfer rates will approach that of the nucleophilic addition reaction.\n",

      ", Accepted 30th September 2019First published on 1st October 2019AbstractCarbon capture is one of the foremost methods for curtailing greenhouse gas emissions. Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinoneâ€“carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40â€“90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\n",
      "Broader context\n",
      "There is a clear scientific consensus on the role of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the unusually wild fluctuations of global climate patterns over the last century, to which carbon dioxide is the largest contributor. This has generated a scientific tide in the study of carbon removal techniques over the last three decades, which has slowly gathered momentum, culminating in the 2015 Paris Agreement, which heavily emphasized the role of carbon removal by tackling emissions or via negative emissions technologies. While a path forward for carbon capture is being shaped by a mix of incumbent actors and newcomers, the great majority of the proposed processes rely on conventional concepts. Moreover, most of these processes have a large balance of plant which hinders their potential to flexibly adapt to the multi-scale nature of carbon capture. Herein, we demonstrate a new approach which presents a paradigm shift in adsorption type processes and carbon capture. The electro-swing basis of our process allows its linear scaling with desired capacity and lends it geometric flexibility. It also allows carbon capture from streams of any concentration, and its release into any carrier streams, including pure CO2, with a low balance of plant.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "With the alarming increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and its implications for global climate pattern developments,1,2 mitigation of climate change through curtailment of anthropogenic CO2 emissions has been one of the most urgent socioeconomic and scientific problems in the global arena over the last decade.3 To this end, a number of technologies have been developed for the large-scale capture of CO2 from combustion and other industrial processes to produce high-purity CO2 streams for storage or valorization.4 The most mature of these technologies are solvent scrubbing, mainly amine scrubbing,5 and oxyfuel combustion,6 which target high CO2 concentration streams (>10%). These approaches have a large footprint and, when retrofitted to a process, can require major modifications to the plant. Consequently, there has been a major effort to develop new materials and processes for high efficiency CO2-capture, including sorbents for pressure and temperature swing adsorption systems,7 and membranes for selective transport of the CO2.8 Furthermore, many potential applications of carbon capture require compact devices due to space limitations, such as in the direct capture of CO2 from tailpipe exhausts on board mobile sources, in which there is growing interest given the large contribution of transportation exhaust to greenhouse gas emissions (33.5% of U.S. CO2 emissions in 2016).9\n",
      "In addition to the capture of CO2 from direct combustion processes, there is a need to remove CO2 from enclosed spaces for ventilation purposes in buildings and car cabins, or for cabin environmental control systems on board spacecraft and submarines, where the maximum allowed CO2 concentration in habitable spaces is 5000 ppm (or 0.5%).10 The first of such systems was developed by Winnick et al., for the electrochemical capture of CO2 in spacecraft cabins using molten carbonates.11 However, the low concentration of CO2 in such applications poses a challenge, mainly due to the low driving forces for mass transfer and the large quantities of other species present in air in addition to CO2.12 Thus, carbon capture is a multi-scale problem, where the CO2-rich streams to be treated vary greatly in volume, concentration and composition, and different criteria need to be fulfilled to ensure optimal processing depending on whether sources are industrial or small-scale (e.g., power plants or oil and gas heaters), concentrated or dilute (exhausts from combustion or air in confined spaces), and clean or contaminated with other pollutants.\n",
      "Many of the CO2-capture chemical processes that involve a capture agent such as amines or solid sorbents require temperature and/or pressure swings to release the captured CO2 and regenerate the agents for further capture. These swings result in inefficiencies due to energy wasted in heating solvents and sorbents, pressurizing feed gas, or drawing a vacuum for desorption. Electrochemical systems can minimize such parasitic energy losses as they can be operated at near isothermal conditions, with significantly higher efficiencies than their thermal-swing (TSA) and pressure-swing (PSA) adsorption counterparts.13 One mode of electrochemical capture of CO2 is through the use of a redox-active carrier.\n",
      "Electrochemically mediated selective transport of chemical species was first reported by Ward et al.,14 where a redox-active carrier (ferrous ion) was used to transport nitric oxide across a membrane. Since then, a number of systems have been developed for transporting chemical species by redox-active carriers that are activated at one electrode, to bind with the target species, and deactivated at the opposite electrode, to release the target and regenerate the carrier.15,16 Systems that have been proposed for the concentration of CO2 through this approach have been based on a number of different carrier molecules, such as quinones,17â€“20 4,4â€²-bipyridine,21 and thiolates.22,23 Quinones are of particular interest to this work for their superior electrochemical performance, serving as redox-active carriers for CO2 in electrochemically mediated separation processes. DuBois et al. demonstrated this possibility, and studied the thermodynamics of an electrochemical CO2 pumping system that utilizes quinones.18 More work followed, where Scovazzo et al. demonstrated the electrochemical separation of CO2 from <1% concentration gas mixtures using 2,6-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone as a carrier in ionic liquid (IL) and organic solvent electrolytes media,19 while Gurkan et al. screened a number of ILs to serve as suitable electrolytes for quinone carriers in an electrochemically mediated selective transport system for CO2.20 All of these systems, however, require the transport of the electrolyte and the dissolved carrier molecules between two electrodes in an electrochemical cell for capture and release of CO2. This limits their implementation in a number of applications where the requirement for flow systems and pumping, and the large footprint, are problematic.\n",
      "In this work, we develop a compact electrochemical device for CO2 capture that eliminates the requirement for complex flow systems, and that can be effective in the treatment of both high and low concentration feed streams. A quinone-utilizing faradaic electrochemical cell that fulfils these requirements and operates as an Electro-Swing Adsorption (ESA) process is illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. The cell is comprised of two cathode electrode substrates coated with a CO2-binding quinoneâ€“carbon nanotube (Qâ€“CNT) composite sandwiching an anode electrode substrate coated with a ferroceneâ€“CNT (Fcâ€“CNT) composite, with separator membranes between the electrodes. This cell architecture is employed to maximize the CO2-binding surface area of the cell exposed to gas flow in a parallel passage adsorbent contactor design where stacks of these cells form parallel gas channels. The Fcâ€“CNT electrode serves as an electron source and sink for the reduction and oxidation, respectively, of the Qâ€“CNT electrodes to regulate the uptake and release of the CO2. Wetting of porous non-woven carbon fiber mats used as the electrode substrates by a room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) electrolyte enables effective ionic currents to pass through the electrolyte on activation and deactivation of the electrodes, and permits the diffusion of CO2 into the electrolyte-wetted cathodes during capture.\n",

      "Schematic of a single electro-swing adsorption electrochemical cell with porous electrodes and electrolyte separators. The outer electrodes, coated with poly-1,4-anthraquinone composite, can capture CO2 on application of a reducing potential via carboxylation of quinone, and release the CO2 on reversal of the polarity. The inner polyvinylferrocene-containing electrode serves as an electron source and sink for the quinone reduction and oxidation, respectively.\n",
      "The effectiveness of the electro-swing concept for CO2 capture and release was demonstrated in a sealed system in which cell polarity was cycled to regulate the activation and deactivation of the carrier, i.e. reduction and oxidation of the redox active quinone. This was in lieu of the advection of the carrier electrolyte solution between two electrodes with a difference in potential.19 The performance of flow-through modules constructed with stacks of the assembled electrode cells was also assessed. The CO2 capture processes were modelled to provide greater insight into the operational principles for this technology.\n",
      "Ultimately, the goal of this work was to demonstrate an electrochemically activated packed parallel passage contactor adsorption system for the removal of CO2 from flue gas and other CO2-rich streams. The regeneration of the bed takes place on reversal of the polarity of the stack in an ESA, with analogies to PSA systems, where adsorption takes place at high pressure and desorption at a lower pressure,24 or TSA systems, where adsorption takes place at low temperatures and the fixed bed is regenerated at higher temperatures.25\n",
      "Results and discussion\n",
      "Design of the electrochemical cell\n",
      "Thin films of crystallized organic compounds have been studied as a means of immobilizing CO2 redox-active carriers onto electrode substrates.26 Redox-active polymers have long been the preferred electrode material when using organic molecules in electrochemical cells, however, because polymers are less soluble in the electrolyte than their corresponding redox-active repeating units, and thus the self-discharge of the cell can be avoided, and its cycling performance improved.27 For example, quinone polymers have been investigated as suitable cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries,28 and pseudocapacitive energy storage devices.29 These polymers are usually made into composites with conductive high-surface area carbon materials, such as carbon black, graphite or carbon nanotubes (CNT), to enhance the overall conductivity of the electrode material and increase the area of the polymer exposed to the electrolyte.30 Here, we used a polyanthraquinoneâ€“CNT (PAQâ€“CNT) composite for the cathode and polyvinylferroceneâ€“CNT (PVFcâ€“CNT) composite for the anode.31 The electrolyte used was the RTIL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([Bmim][TF2N]), selected for its low volatility, which allows for flow of gas over the wetted electrodes without loss of electrolyte to evaporation or entrainment.\n",
      "A sealed chamber was constructed in which CO2 capture and release on electrochemical activation and deactivation of the quinones, respectively, was indicated by the concomitant pressure changes in the chamber. A flow cell was also fabricated to house stacks of the electrochemical cells to allow for capture of CO2 from flowing gas streams of compositions similar to those of flue gases, air in aircraft cabins and buildings, and in the ambient environment. The adsorption effectiveness was assessed through analysis of the breakthrough profiles.\n",
      "The chemical specificity of quinones can provide near 100% purity of released CO2, which, when combined with a well-designed process in which 100% CO2 recovery is achieved, puts the technology much closer to the upper-right corner on the recovery-purity Pareto plot than those based on current CO2 sorbents.32,33\n",
      "Polyanthraquinone electrodes.\n",
      "Poly(1,4-anthraquinone) (P14AQ), shown in Fig. 1, was synthesized and incorporated into an ink with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). Non-woven carbon fiber mat electrode substrates of thickness 150 Î¼m (35 g mâˆ’2) were dip-coated in the ink and dried very slowly to obtain a composite that uniformly coated the substrate at âˆ¼1.2 mg cmâˆ’2, shown in Fig. 2(a). The composite structure allows for a greater utilization of the anthraquinone repeating units in the polymers, and thus larger currents under applied potentials. The CNT mesh, shown in Fig. 2(f), provides a backbone to improve the conductivity of the conjugated PAQ via Ï€â€“Ï€ interactions with the anthraquinone units (Fig. S3, ESIâ€ ); it also provides a porous matrix decorated by the polymer chains for better electrolyte penetration. This results in a larger surface area of the polymer being exposed to electrolyte, and an increased conductivity in the composite.34 The Ï€â€“Ï€ interaction of the polymer chains and CNTs, and the subsequent decoration of the nanotubes with the polymer chains, shown in Fig. 2(e), also improved the suspension of the CNTs in the polymer solution, which resulted in very well dispersed inks. The ratio of PAQ to CNT was optimized, with the highest current per mass of active material (polymer) obtained at a 1:3, PAQ:CNT ratio by weight (Fig. S4, ESIâ€ ). The cyclic voltammograms in Fig. 3 shown in green (under N2) and red (under CO2) indicate the strong redox activity of these electrode surfaces; the differences in the current response following potential scans are discussed later.\n",

      "A counter electrode with a reduction potential more positive than the oxidative CO2 release potential of PAQâ€“CNT is required to make an electrochemical cell that can effectively capture and release CO2. Therefore, the anode electrode material for the electrochemical cell with PAQâ€“CNT cathode was a composite of polyvinylferrocene and CNT (PVFcâ€“CNT), shown in Fig. 1. This was prepared by dispersing MWCNTs in a solution of PVFc in NMP. The optimum ratio of the composite was found to be 1:1, PVFc:CNT, by weight. The electrode substrate was dip-coated in the ink and dried slowly to yield a composite that uniformly coated the substrate at âˆ¼1.4 mg cmâˆ’2, as shown in Fig. 4. The CVs of the PVFcâ€“CNT electrode in N2 and CO2 saturated [Bmim][TF2N] are identical, and are indicated by the blue line in Fig. 3.

      "The electrochemical cell.\n",
      "The PAQâ€“CNT electrodes were assembled into an electrochemical cell in which CO2 was able to be captured and released upon potential swings. This was accomplished by layering a PVFcâ€“CNT counter electrode between the two PAQâ€“CNT electrodes to balance the charge of these electrodes, as shown in Fig. 5(d). In a CO2-rich environment, this afforded a polymer-based battery with an electrochemical window of âˆ¼1.2 V, where all the charge from the ferrocene oxidation, at its reduction potential, was balanced by the charge transferred to the two-electron reduction of quinone, at its first reduction potential. This window is defined by the reduction potential of PVFcâ€“CNT and the first reduction potential of PAQâ€“CNT, shown in Fig. 3 as Î”V1. However, in the absence of CO2 or other such electrophiles, mainly under N2, PAQ retains its two one-electron reductions, with half of the charge of the ferrocene oxidation being balanced by the reduction of quinone at the first potential and the other half by its reduction at the second potential. This results in a wider electrochemical window, shown in Fig. 3 as Î”V2, and the behavior of the cell resembles that of an asymmetric pseudocapacitor.35\n",

      "The capacities of the anode and cathodes of the cell, evaluated by gravimetric charge calibration of the two electrode composite materials (Fig. S5, ESIâ€ ), were balanced by requiring that mP14AQâ€“CNT = 1.12mPFVcâ€“CNT, which allowed for some excess PVFcâ€“CNT.\n",
      "Carbon capture\n",
      "Two different types of units were fabricated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the electro-swing process. The first was a sealed chamber into which the electrodes were inserted. Changes in pressure were measured as CO2 was adsorbed and then released on cycling of the potential applied to the electrodes. The second approach used a flow adsorption in which the CO2 exiting the device was monitored, with the breakthrough point reflecting the overall capacity of the electrodes. All carbon capture experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "CO2 capture and release in a batch system.\n",
      "An electrochemical cell (4 cm2 of total exposed area) with the three layers, such as that illustrated in Fig. 1, was tested for the capture and release of CO2 in a sealed chamber, shown in Fig. 5. This cell had âˆ¼4.8 mg of PAQâ€“CNT deposited, i.e. 5.8 Î¼mol of quinone, or a capacity for 11.6 Î¼mol of CO2. From the monitored pressure changes in the chamber of known internal void volume, the number of moles of CO2 captured and released upon charge and discharge of the cell at constant potentials, were calculated. The chamber was purged with CO2 at the desired concentrations and sealed at atmospheric pressure. The pressure inside was allowed to equilibrate at constant temperature before the electrochemical experiments were started.\n",
      "The performance of the electrochemical cell was evaluated in chronoamperometric (potentiostatic) experiments, with capture at 1.3 V and release at 0.5 V, i.e. Î”V = 0.8 V. Fig. 6(a) shows the change in the number of moles of CO2 captured from pure gas over 10 cycles (blue), along with the charge transferred to and from the cell (red). It shows that âˆ¼65% of the quinone units were utilized, i.e. 7.4 Î¼mol of CO2 captured. This may be due to incomplete charging of the quinones that are not exposed to electrolyte. From the charge transferred during charging and discharge (âˆ¼800 mC), and the moles of CO2 captured and released, a faradaic efficiencyÂ (1)of up to 90% was estimated, with some of the charge lost to double layer charging of the porous electrodes. Here, F is Faraday's constant, Q is the charge transferred, and n is the number of moles of useful electrons transferred in the reaction, i.e. used for the capture of CO2, which in this reaction, is equivalent to the number of moles of CO2. This efficiency results in âˆ¼86 kJ per mole of CO2 captured and released, as determined by the relationÂ (2)where Î”V is the difference between the applied charge and discharge potentials.\n",

      "(a) Changes in the number of moles of CO2 captured upon charging and discharge of the electrochemical cell over 10 cycles, normalized by the moles of quinone on the electrode ().

(b) The CO2 captured under different feed concentrations. (c) Capacity of cell over 7000 cycles. In a different set of experiments using a larger cell and cavity, (d) shows the effect of varying charging potential for a 1000 s capture and (e) shows the effect of varying the capture duration at âˆ’1.8 V capture potential. These experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "Fig. 6(b) shows similar results for the capture of CO2 from gases of different concentrations ranging between 15 and 100%. Again, quinone utilization was high, but dependent on the initial gas concentration, owing not to capacity limitations, but to a reduction on sorption dynamics due to mass transfer limitations with lower concentration driving forces. The electrochemical cell showed great stability with <30% loss in capacity over 7000 cycles of capture and release, Fig. 6(c). The gradual loss in capacity is mainly due to the electromigration of the shorter polymer chains, Fig. S1 (ESIâ€ ), from the electrode and into the electrolyte, towards the opposite electrode.\n",
      "In a different set of experiments where a larger cell (âˆ¼450 cm2 of total exposed area) was used, CO2 transport limitations became more prominent due to the larger internal volume of the cavity used. In this set, the effect of applying an overpotential was studied, where capture potentials of greater than Î”V1 (in Fig. 3) were applied during a 1000 s capture experiment. Fig. 6(d) shows that upon increasing the applied capture potential more CO2 is captured for the duration of the experiment, which indicates the activation of more quinone units on the electrodes during the charging half-cycle. Charging the system at âˆ’1.8 V for varying durations, Fig. 6(e), shows that the system is fully charged after 2000 s, but more CO2 is captured, i.e. more of the quinones are utilized, at increasing durations of capture. This demonstrates the transport limitations of the electrodes, as explained in later sections.\n",
      "CO2 capture and release in flow systems.\n",
      "The adsorption bed assembled consisted of a few electrochemical cells stacked in the flow device to allow the flow of gas in between, as illustrated in Fig. 7(a). The blue regions indicate the presence of CO2, and the decrease in blue intensity within the channel indicates the adsorption front, ahead of which the bed is still empty, and behind which the bed, i.e. the electrode assembly, is saturated with CO2 and cannot adsorb more. A number of different cells were constructed in the flow bed configuration shown in Fig. 7(b). The exposed area of a typical cell was 18 cm Ã— 10 cm, with âˆ¼0.2 g of P14AQâ€“CNT composite; at âˆ¼70% useful quinones, this amounted to the adsorption of âˆ¼9â€“14 cm3 of CO2. The channels between the cells were typically âˆ¼500 Î¼m thick, and bed volumes were about 35 cm3 with a total bed weight of âˆ¼1.5 g bringing the productivity of the bed to 0.01â€“0.02 kg CO2 per kgbedtb, where tb is the breakthrough time, i.e. the time to reach saturation of the electrodes or for the outlet CO2 concentration to begin to increase. At feed flow rates of âˆ¼10 mL minâˆ’1 and 15% CO2, this productivity is on par with the TSA systems reported by Ntiamoah et al.36\n",

      "(a) Schematic illustration of the parallel passage electrochemical cell contactor. The blue region indicates the saturated zone and the development of the mass transfer zone. (b) Photograph of a flow bed with a stack of the electrochemical cells.\n",
      "It can be shown that axial flow dispersion within individual channels was minimal at most flow rates, and that the transport resistances resided primarily within the electrodes. Imperfect packing of the cells in the flow device by hand did, in some cases, lead to significant channeling and large-scale device axial dispersion, however, with broad breakthrough curves, but it is anticipated that under optimal manufacturing conditions these effects can be reduced significantly.\n",
      "The chronoamperometric experiments performed in the sealed system were repeated in a flow system. Mixtures of N2 and CO2 at different compositions were flown past the stack of assembled electrochemical cells. Upon reduction of the PAQâ€“CNT electrodes, CO2 was removed (captured) from the inlet stream, and the decrease in the concentration of CO2 was detected at the outlet stream. In these experiments the bed was fully activated by charging at a constant potential greater than Î”V22 to guarantee the complete reduction of the all accessible quinone units prior to adsorption. Experiments with an initial half activation, i.e., at Î”V1, followed by adsorption at constant potential, did not result in different breakthrough curves, mainly because the kinetics of the reduction and the adsorption reactions are much faster than the rates of mass transfer of CO2 into the film, as discussed later.\n",
      "The breakthrough profiles obtained for one flow system are shown in Fig. 8(a). Breakthrough was achieved at smaller bed volumes of gas treated for higher feed CO2 concentrations, where the bed volume is a time measure which represents the total volume of gas treated at any given time relative to the volume of the bed itself. The breakthrough curves superimpose when normalized by the inlet CO2 concentration, shown in Fig. 8(b), which indicates a consistent behavior of the bed, i.e. equal utilization of the overall adsorption capacity regardless of the inlet concentration, an indication of a rectangular equilibrium isotherm. Note in this particular module that, although the breakthrough curves themselves were sharp, prior to breakthrough there was a consistent effluent concentration of 20% of the feed concentration, the result of a bypassing of the active cells by 20% of the total gas flow. The overall capacity of the bed can be calculated from the area between the line at Cout/Cin = 1 and the normalized breakthrough curve. A contactor bed of a desired overall capacity can be designed by linear scaling from this overall capacity. With a larger bed, CO2 was fully captured from a stream at 10% inlet concentration, which is on the higher end for carbon capture applications as it mimics combustion exhaust. Up to 10 bed volumes of feed were treated before breakthrough was achieved, indicating capacity of greater than one bed volume of pure CO2. It has similarly been shown that complete removal of CO2 with a smaller stack of cells (a scaled down contactor), five replicate capture experiments were conducted on an inlet stream of âˆ¼0.8% CO2, Fig. 8(d), which mimics conditions for ventilation of confined living spaces, such as space modules, submarines and buildings. The breakthrough curves were unaffected by the prior history of the bed, indicating that complete regeneration and restoration of the bed capacity was attained during the desorption following each adsorption run.\n",

      "(a) Breakthrough profiles obtained at four inlet concentrations. (b) Same breakthrough profiles in (a) normalized by the inlet concentrations. (c) Breakthrough profile obtained from a large system operating at âˆ¼10% inlet concentration. (d) Breakthrough profiles obtained from five replicate runs of a smaller system operating at âˆ¼0.8% inlet concentration. These experiments were conducted at T âˆ¼ 21 Â°C.\n",
      "The broadness of the breakthrough profiles in Fig. 8(c) and (d) can be attributed to the variation in channel width. Since the electrochemical cell stacks are hand-assembled and fitted into the bed, some variation in channel width along the same channel and the parallel channels can cause an uneven distribution of flow resulting in overlapping of multiple breakthrough profiles, which culminate in a broad overall profile. Also, mass-transfer dispersion plays a significant role in the broadness of the profiles. As is evident from the long durations for an effective capture in Fig. 6(e), and discussed later, mass transfer of CO2 into the electrodes is the rate controlling step, and this causes axial dispersion that widens the mass transfer zone in the channel, illustrated in Fig. 7(a), resulting in broad breakthrough profiles in this case.\n",
      "Mechanism of CO2 capture\n",
      "Mizen and Wrighton first demonstrated the reductive addition of CO2 to 9,10-phenanthrenequinone in aprotic electrolytes. Quinones undergo two reversible one-electron reductions in aprotic electrolytes, at two reduction potentials, as shown in Scheme 1(a) for anthraquinone. But in the presence of CO2, a single two-electron quasi-reversible reduction takes place at the first reduction potential, as shown in Scheme 1(b), where the CO2 molecule carboxylates the quinone resulting in a carbonate salt.37 Upon the first reduction of a quinone molecule, a semiquinone radical anion is produced. Some semiquinones, with sufficient electron density, i.e. sufficient Lewis base strength, can react with CO2 in a nucleophilic addition to form a carbonate salt. Semiquinones with lower electron density â€“ due to attached electron withdrawing groups â€“ do not have the nucleophilic strength to react with CO2.38 A semiquinone carboxylated by the reductive addition of CO2 has its negative charge isolated from the rest of the molecule by a Ïƒ-bond, rendering the carboxylated quinone aromatic ring(s) relatively neutral. Hence, the two-electron reduction of the parent quinone under CO2 occurs at the first reduction potential. The second reduction generates another nucleophilic center, i.e. the second oxygen of the quinone, which reacts with a second CO2 molecule to form a bis(carbonate) dianion salt â€“ the quinol dianion diadduct. A similar behavior is observed when quinones are reduced in protic electrolyte media and the reduced quinones react with protons to form two hydroxyl groups via a two-electron reduction.39\n",

      "(a) Two single-electron reduction waves of anthraquinone in the absence of electrophiles. (b) One two-electron reduction wave of anthraquinone in the presence of CO2.\n",
      "The nucleophilic addition reaction of reduced quinones occurs only with electrophiles with sufficient Lewis acidity, such as CO2, and not N2, hence the great selectivity in adsorption. Furthermore, water, in the treated gas stream, has minimal effect on carbon capture, mainly because the hydrophobicity of the IL used presents a considerable mass transfer resistance for water with very little retention,40 and any residual water in the IL phase merely stabilizes the reduced quinones,41 with no significant change to the electrochemical or chemical steps of the carbon capture process.20 While the presence of oxygen can cause the oxidation of some reduced quinones with a sufficiently negative reduction potential, through the formation of the superoxide radical anion O2Ë™âˆ’, it is possible to avoid any reactions with oxygen in the feed stream by carefully tuning the electron density of the quinone polymer.42\n",
      "The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the PAQâ€“CNT composite on the electrode substrate in [Bmim][TF2N] saturated with N2, the green line in Fig. 3, shows two redox couples corresponding to the two reduction potentials of anthraquinone. The cathodic and anodic peaks, however, are broader than those reported for solutions of quinone molecules in electrolytes,20 which can be ascribed to the slower electron exchange between differently-reduced redox units, i.e. neutral quinone, semiquinone (radical anion) and quinol dianion, along the Ï€-conjugated backbone of the polymer,43 and also to the diffusion and electromigration of electrolytic species into and out of the porous PAQâ€“CNT film.44 The expected disappearance of the second redox couple of the CV under CO2 was observed, as shown by the red line in Fig. 3, and attributed to the carboxylation of the reduced quinone units along the polymer chain facilitating the second electron reduction of anthraquinone at the first reduction potential, with the consequent increase in the current at that potential. The PAQâ€“CNT electrode can therefore be used to remove CO2 selectively from a gas mixture via nucleophilic addition, and regenerated via an electrochemical oxidation, with release of the CO2, as shown earlier. The two reduction potentials under N2 are E01 = âˆ’1.21 V and E02 = âˆ’1.63 V, vs. Fc. Under CO2 these two potentials coalesce to yield a single quasi-reversible redox couple at the first reduction potential observed under N2, i.e. E01.\n",
      "The separation of the oxidation and reduction peaks in the CVs reported is large, indicating sluggish electron transfer to the quinone repeat units on the polymer, and a thick diffusion layer in the porous electrode.44 While the ratio of polymer to CNT was optimized for the greatest gravimetric capacity, it is not the ideal ratio for conductivity. Some of the conductivity takes place through the backbone of the polymer, which contributes to the slow electron transfer. This, however, does not present a problem in the design of the contactor separation unit, since the rate limiting step in the CO2 capture process is the transport of CO2 and not electron transfer.\n",
      "The double carboxylation (CO2 addition) of anthraquinone to form the bis(carbonate) dianion follows an ECEC mechanism, as shown in Scheme 2(a). During a constant-current charging of the cell in the presence of a flux of CO2 towards the quinone units equal to, or higher than, the rate of the electrochemical reduction of the quinones, both of the reduction electrochemical reactions take place at the first reduction potential, E01. The molar flux of CO2, NCO2, towards the electrode (moles per unit area per second) should match the current density, J, at the electrode (charge per unit area per second), as in,Â (3)Conversely, if the flux of CO2 is lower than the rate of reduction, some of the semiquinones produced in the first reduction are not carboxylated but are instead reduced to quinol dianions at the more negative second potential, E02, as shown in Scheme 2(b). In this case, for the same number of moles of semiquinone being reduced, and hence electrons, i.e. charge, transferred, more energy is required in accordance with eqn (2).\n",

      "CO2 deprivation was not a problem in the highly saturated electrolyte in the CV electrochemical characterizations, where the concentration of CO2 in the electrolyte was about 20 times higher than that of the quinones on the electrode. However, in an adsorption system, where the electrolyte is not saturated with CO2 there needs to be a careful balance between the advective and diffusive fluxes of CO2 towards the anthraquinone cathodes for reductive addition, and the rate of the reduction of anthraquinone. This can be better controlled by charging the cell, i.e. reducing the anthraquinone, at a constant potential that is sufficient to drive the first reduction of anthraquinone but not the second, i.e. charging the cell at a potential difference that is between Î”V1 and Î”V2. With operation at this constant potential, the flux of CO2 does not affect the energy of binding, since the second electron is acquired by a semiquinone at the first reduction potential, but only after the first CO2 addition occurs; following this second reduction, a second CO2 molecule can bind to the dianion monoadduct. When the first reduction is allowed in a CO2-lean environment at a constant potential, the current observed after the initial surge, which results from the first reduction, is proportional to the flux of CO2 towards the anthraquinone electrode. Nevertheless, this current ultimately diminishes due to the decrease in the number of semiquinones available to react with CO2. In a CO2-rich environment, at constant potential charging, the observed current after the initial surge is proportional to the transport of CO2 into the electrode and the rate of the addition reaction which follows the nucleophilic addition mechanism between semiquinones and dissolved CO2,Â R = kCQË™âˆ’CCO2,IL(4)where R is the rate of the reaction and k is the rate constant. The electrochemical steps proceed at a faster rate than the chemical reactions, but both types of reactions have rates that are faster than the rate of diffusion of CO2 in the IL, leading to a large DamkÃ¶hler number,Â (5)where CQ is the initial concentration of anthraquinone repeat units on the electrode, CCO2 is the concentration of CO2 in the IL, L is the thickness of the IL-wetted porous electrode, which is about 150 Î¼m, and DCO2,IL is the diffusion coefficient of CO2 in the IL and is about 4 Ã— 10âˆ’10 m2 sâˆ’1. While it is the semiquinone that participates in the reaction here, the initial concentration CQ is a good approximation for estimating the order of magnitude of Da. The rate constant can be estimated to be 102 Mâˆ’1 sâˆ’1,37 resulting in Da âˆ¼104. Large values of Da indicate that mass transfer will control the process and thus the charging and subsequent carboxylation of the quinones can be assumed to be in equilibrium with the prevailing CO2 concentration at any position and at any time. Therefore, with a reduced thickness of the electrodes, the CO2 mass transfer rates will approach that of the nucleophilic addition reaction.\n",

      "Carbon capture is one of the foremost methods for curtailing greenhouse gas emissions. Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\n",

In the first two electrochemical reactions shown in Scheme 2(a), the reduced species are QË™âˆ’ and Q(CO2)2âˆ’, while the species of higher oxidation number in these two reactions are Q and Q(CO2)Ë™âˆ’ respectively. The standard reduction potential for both reactions is E01. While the first of the two electrochemical reactions in Scheme 2(b) is the same as that of Scheme 2(a), the second reaction has Q2âˆ’ as the reduced species and QË™âˆ’ as the species with higher oxidation number, with a standard reduction potential of E02. Likewise, in the anode oxidation reaction, Fc+ (ferrocenium) is the oxidized species and Fc (ferrocene) is the reduced species at E0 = âˆ’0.03 V. The current densities of these reactions were described by the Butlerâ€“Volmer equation,Â (7)where Î· is the overpotential and Î±, the symmetry factor, was approximated to be 0.5 for all the electrochemical reactions. The exchange current, i0, is given byÂ i0 = k0[red]Î±[ox](1âˆ’Î±)(8)The governing mass transfer equations for all the species involved in the electrochemical reaction, including the supporting electrolyte cations and anions, isÂ (9)where Ci is the concentration of the species, Ri is the rate of reaction in which the species is involved and Ni is the flux, which is zero for all immobilized faradaic species: anthraquinone in its different oxidation and binding states, and ferrocene.

The current density can be obtained from the flux of charged mobile species in the electrolyteÂ (11)and the overall electroneutrality is maintained by ensuring thatÂ (12)The boundary conditions for these equations are ground (Î¦ = 0 V) for the anthraquinone electrode (colored grey in Fig. 9), and either constant current or constant potential at the ferrocene electrode (pink). The electrochemical model is the same for both sealed and flow systems, although the transport of CO2 in the gas phase (shown as a transparent block) is different in the two scenarios.\n",

      "In the sealed system, CO2 transport occurs via diffusion toward the electrode only, while in flow CO2 is also advected down the channel. In the sealed system, the partial pressure of the gas decreases during capture, while in flow the CO2 concentration changes along the gas channel with time, and the concentration of the gas leaving the device is a measure of the total effectiveness of the adsorption bed capacity and transport and kinetic limitations within the system. The total transport of CO2 is modelled by transport equations in each of the two phases, gas and IL. In the gas phase, the mass transfer governing equation in the sealed system is given byÂ (13)where CCO2,gas is the concentration of CO2 in the gas phase, obtained from its partial pressure and the ideal gas law. This governing equation has a no-flux boundary condition at the three wallsÂ (14)and at the gasâ€“IL interface, the fluxes normal to the interface are set to be equalÂ (15)where CCO2,IL is the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the IL phase. In the flow system, the flux of CO2 has an advective component as well and the governing equation becomesÂ (16)where u is the velocity of the gas flowing in the channel. The inlet is set at a constant concentration inflow and the outlet at zero gauge pressure. The mass transfer governing equation for dissolved CO2 in the IL phase, for both sealed and flow systems, is given byÂ (17)where R is a bulk reaction term describing the rate of the chemical reactions shown in Scheme 2(a). Simple rate equations, first order in all reactants, are used. A no-flux boundary condition is set at the walls. At the gasâ€“electrode interface, the concentration of dissolved CO2 is set toÂ CCO2,IL = Î²CCO2,gas(18)where Î² is the adjusted Henry's constant which accounts for the equilibrium partition of CO2 between the gas and IL phases.\n",

      "The simulation of constant-current charging at 0â€“5% CO2 concentrations in the sealed system in which the gas channel shown in Fig. 9 served as a gas headspace, shows results that are consistent with the aforementioned mechanism of CO2 capture. In addition to the cell voltage, the concentrations of all the cathode quinonic species were studied during the charging process. Fig. 10 shows the cell voltages at 0â€“5% CO2 and the concentration profiles of cathode species at 0, 2, and 5% CO2. The cell voltage profiles in Fig. 10(a) show that as the concentration of CO2 increases, less of the cell charging occurs at the higher potential. At 0% CO2 the cell simply traverses both reduction potentials of the quinone, and the species profiles in Fig. 10(b) show two consecutive conversions; the first is the reduction of quinone to semiquinone, and the second is the reduction of semiquinone to quinol dianion. The second reaction starts only after all the quinone is converted to semiquinone, and to further accommodate the incoming electrons at the constant current, the second, more energetic reduction takes place until all faradaic reactions are exhausted. Here, the simulation was stopped just short of full conversion to avoid numerical complications that arise from the exhaustion of faradaic material, i.e. complete charging. At 2% CO2, upon generation of the semiquinone, shown in Fig. 10(c), the modest diffusive flux of CO2 allows for the formation of the semiquinone monoadduct which soon accepts a second electron at the first reduction potential of quinone, hence extending the cell charging period spent at the lower potential. This dianion monoadduct can then react with a second CO2 molecule, to form the dianion diadduct. But, upon the depletion of CO2 in the vicinity of the cathode, due to a charging rate that is faster than the diffusive flux of CO2 into the electrolyte at 2% headspace concentration, the semiquinone is converted to the dianion at the higher second potential, while the concentrations of the dianion monoadduct and the dianion diadduct remain constant. This is reflected in the potential profile at 2% CO2 in Fig. 10(a). However, at 5% CO2, the diffusive flux of CO2 is adequate, and barely any semiquinone can be detected since it is converted to semiquinone monoadduct, and other subsequent species, soon after generation, shown in Fig. 10(d). Here, all the electrochemical reactions take place at the first potential and none of the semiquinone is converted to quinol dianion.\n",

      "Hence, the optimum charging method of the cell, i.e. CO2 capture, is to operate at a constant potential just larger than the first potential window Î”V1. The greater the charging voltage, the faster the reduction reaction due to the larger overpotential. For practical reasons, and to avoid large current surges, the cell can be charged at a constant current until the desired charging potential difference is reached. This will be between Î”V1 and Î”V2 based on the rate of charging desired. At this point the bed is activated for capture by making half the total capture capacity available. Then the cell can be set at that constant potential until saturation of the cathodes is achieved. The second half of the capture capacity is made available as more CO2 flows in.\n",
      "It is also possible to fully activate the bed by charging at a potential difference Î”VHigh > Î”V1, at which point the cells are disconnected and allowed to saturate with no further supply of current, until breakthrough is achieved, and the bed is regenerated by discharging the cell and releasing pure CO2. The energy recovered however, cannot exceed QÎ”V1, resulting in an energy loss of greater than Q(Î”VHigh âˆ’ Î”V1).\n",
      "Model results for flow system.\n",
      "The model described above was also used to simulate the capture of CO2 from a channel under flow conditions. The gas flowed parallel to the electrodes in the cell, a cross-section of which is shown in Fig. 9. The simulated concentration profiles in the channel and the quinone electrode are shown as a function of the number of bed volumes in Fig. 11(a). The gas phase profiles are consistent with a dispersed plug flow in the channels, with a reasonably sharp adsorption front, while the linear CO2 profiles in the electrode are a result of the significant diffusional limitations in this region. Of particular interest is the depletion of unbound quinonic species in the cathode as removal of CO2 from the channel proceeds; as the cathode becomes saturated with CO2, the concentration of CO2 increases along the length of the channel until breakthrough is achieved at around 8 bed volumes, after which further saturation is allowed until the outlet concentration is equal to the inlet concentration at around 10 bed volumes. Fig. 11(b) and (c) show the breakthrough profiles as a function of cell voltage for a given feed concentration, and of feed concentration for a given cell voltage, respectively. The number of bed volumes required increases with decreasing feed concentrations, a result of the fixed overall bed capacity and the rectangular nature of the adsorption isotherm of this system. In the absence of transport and reaction limitations, all breakthrough curves should collapse when the bed volume is multiplied by the feed fraction of the adsorbate; the fact that this is not exactly so in Fig. 11(d) indicates that mass transfer limitations do play a role in the uptake of CO2 by the activated electrodes. Nevertheless, the overall capacity, indicated by the trapezoidal area under Cout/Cin = 1 and the breakthrough curves, remained constant. However, the effect of a stronger driving force on improved mass transfer is evident in Fig. 11(b), where at charging potentials that are closer to Î”V2, more of the dianion is generated in a Nernstian distribution, which provides two reaction sites for CO2. This results in a stronger driving force in the adsorption of CO2 and hence improved mass transfer, which yields a sharper breakthrough profile.\n",

      "Fig. 11(e) and (f) show the current across the electrochemical cell during the capture experiments in (c) and (b) respectively. Fig. 11(e) shows that at low potential charging, i.e. 1.3 V, an initial spike in current is observed which results from the reduction of the quinones on the electrodes to semiquinone, as explained earlier. This is followed by a region of constant current which is proportional to the flux of CO2 into the electrodes, since it reacts with the semiquinones and allows them to accept a second electron at the low potential. As the electrodes become saturated and all the semiquinone is depleted, the current decreases. This region of constant current followed by the sharp decrease is very broad for the 10% case, but much shorter for the 50% case, where there is a brief transition from the initial spike to the decreasing current region manifested in a shoulder. However, Fig. 11(f) shows that as the applied capture potential increases, the current profile for the same inlet concentration changes dramatically. This is elucidated in Scheme 3; as the applied potential approaches Î”V2, all of the quinone is reduced to semiquinone and a Nernstian distribution of semiquinone and quinol dianion is generated, evident by the increasing current in the first peak.\n",
      "Scheme 3\n",
      "The reduction of anthraquinone at a potential higher than its second reduction potential with a limited flux of CO2.\n",
      "Thus, CO2 reacts with the Nernstian mixture of semiquinone and quinol dianion, where in the case of the latter no further reaction, chemical or electrochemical, occurs, but in the case of the former a semiquinone monoadduct species is formed, which can be reduced to the dianion monoadduct at Î”V1. Therefore, the applied potential presents a large overpotential for this reaction, hence the second increase in the current which corresponds to the electron transfer for this reduction. Following these steps, all the quinone moieties in the electrodes are in their doubly charged states and no further electron transfer occurs. This double peak behavior of the current is the result of the balance between the rate of electron transfer and the flux of CO2, which relates to the earlier discussions. At charging potentials higher than Î”V2e.g. Î”VHigh, not shown here, a larger first peak is expected where all the quinone is converted to semiquinone then dianion, i.e. two consecutive single-electron reductions, after which the current drops to zero and only chemical addition reactions occur, Scheme 2(b).\n",
      "Energetic analysis of CO2 release\n",
      "The applied release potential determines the energy recovered from the cell upon the release of CO2, and must, therefore, be selected carefully. While quinones under N2 are expected to be reduced and oxidized reversibly without any significant loss of energy, in an electrophile-rich environment, such as CO2, the reduction is only quasi-reversible due to the energetic penalty of breaking a bond formed with CO2. Therefore, some of the energy is lost in the process, and it is imperative to minimize this loss, since it is directly related to energy per mole of CO2 concentrated (captured and released) in a CO2 capture process. The last step in the CO2 capture, Scheme 1(b), i.e. the addition of a second molecule of CO2 to the semiquinone monoadduct to form a dianion diadduct, is chemically irreversible for the duration of the cycle,37 and the release reaction takes place via an electrochemical oxidation of the diadduct. This oxidation occurs at a more positive potential than the first reduction potential E01. Thus, the more positive the release potential, the larger the overpotential and the faster and more complete is the release of the bound CO2. However, a more positive release voltage corresponds to less energy recovered during discharge, and thus more work done per cycle of capture and release, which is given by eqn (2).\n",
      "Consequently, to reduce energy losses per cycle, a less positive potential can be used in a constant potential discharge. While the capture cell voltage can be maintained at fairly minimal levels by setting it close to Î”V1, with some diminishment in rate, release at high cell voltages can result in a partial release of CO2, due to the partial oxidation of the bis(carbonate) quinone units (dianion diadduct units), and a subsequent underutilization of anthraquinone. After a few cycles of capture and release at a higher potential, a constant equilibrium rate of utilization of anthraquinone is achieved. This is akin to the working capacity of a pressure-swing adsorption system.45 Thus partial release can be achieved at higher cell discharge potentials as shown in Fig. 12. This allows for a much smaller window of operation, which at the âˆ¼90% faradaic efficiency reported earlier, an energy use of âˆ¼43 kJ molâˆ’1, with 60% utilization of accessible quinone is possible. This is on par with other carbon capture systems in efficiency and energy consumption,46,47 including thermal swing systems.48\n",
      "Fig. 12\n",
      "Fraction of CO2 released from the PAQâ€“CNT electrode with release voltage. At a constant capture cell voltage of 1.3 V, less of the bed is recovered with increasing release cell voltage, but the energy per mole of CO2 captured and released also decreases.\n",
      "Solid sorbent materials used in carbon capture applications have enthalpies of CO2 adsorption of the same order, e.g., Metalâ€“Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with 30â€“50 kJ molâˆ’1 for some types of MOF-74,49 and âˆ¼100 kJ molâˆ’1 for some amine functionalized MOFs,50 or zeolites, such as 13X at 40 kJ molâˆ’1.51 However, these are not process energetics but rather enthalpies of adsorption. Therefore, processes which are designed to utilize these materials incur greater energetic penalties associated with the techniques used for delivering the energy for desorption, i.e. heat and pressure change, whereas the energetics reported herein correspond to that of the process, which unlike those utilizing solid sorbents, has a binary affinity for CO2.\n",
      "Moreover, if a precise rate of release is desired, the cell can be discharged at a constant current. In this case, the flux of the released CO2 is proportional to the current density, as given by eqn (3). The discharge current and time, control the charge transferred, which is the extensive variable in the work of the process. This method of release is seldom utilized in swing adsorption processes, because it is the intensive, rather than the extensive variable, that is modulated, e.g., temperature in thermal swing, pressure in pressure swing, and, here, potential. Nevertheless, this can be useful for fast regeneration of the bed at high currents, where long periods of capture and short periods of release are desired. But due to the incomplete discharge of the electrochemical cells, in analogy with high current discharge of batteries,30 the bed will only be partially regenerated.\n",
      "Swing operations\n",
      "The electro-swing adsorption (ESA) technology developed in this work has a number of perceived advantages over other swing technologies such as temperature- (TSA) and pressure-swing (PSA) adsorption in terms of both its mode of operation and its thermodynamic adsorption characteristics, as illustrated in Fig. 13. Temperature-swing operations require heating and cooling of the entire adsorption matrix to release the adsorbed compounds, rather than just targeting the adsorption sites themselves, which introduces many thermal inefficiencies to the operation. The heating is typically accomplished with high-temperature steam as the sweep gas, with subsequent condensation of the steam to recover the pure CO2 product stream, whereas cooling is achieved during the blowdown phase in preparation for the next sorption cycle. With pressure-swing operations, the release of the captured material occurs on reduction of the adsorbate partial pressure in the sweep to reverse the mass transfer driving force, which can be achieved either by drawing a vacuum on the bed, or by using low pressure steam as the sweep gas. The product leaving the bed is dilute, and requires a second separation step, such as the condensation of steam, and external compression of the resulting CO2 to bring it to the desired pressures for subsequent utilization or for transportation and subsurface sequestration in geologic formations. Moreover, in both TSA and PSA operations, the working capacity is strongly dependent on the shape of the Langmuir- (or Freundlich-) type isotherm, with significantly lower capacities at lower concentrations, which limits the degree of regeneration of the adsorbent, or the partial pressure of the recovered adsorbate in the sweep stream. The electro-swing adsorbents, on the other hand, are characterized by a rectangular adsorption isotherm in which the saturation loading capacity in the activated state is independent of the gas phase concentration, so the adsorbent is equally effective over a wide range of feed concentrations from ambient conditions through to those characteristic of large scale power and industrial facilities. When deactivated, the adsorbent has negligible capacity for the CO2 even at high CO2 gas phase concentrations such that the working capacity of the adsorbent is independent of operating conditions. Thus, the sweep stream during the desorption process can be pure CO2 at the desired pressure, subject primarily to equipment design constraints, which greatly simplifies the adsorption/desorption cycle relative to those of the TSA and PSA processes. The results in Fig. 6(a) show that release into a pure CO2 gas environment is facile and fast, and complete if sufficient time is allowed to account for the kinetics of the process.\n",

      "Conclusions\n",
      "The electro-swing operations outlined in this paper offer a new approach to the exploitation of electrochemically mediated complexation of CO2 with redox-active species for the mitigation of CO2 emissions, and for control of CO2 levels in confined environments. Electro-swing adsorption has been shown to be equally effective, at a constant capacity, for the capture of CO2 at concentrations typical of fossil fuel combustion flue gases (âˆ¼10%) and in confined ambient environments (0.6â€“0.8%). These advances have been made possible by the development of new electrode materials in which redox-active moieties, such as quinones, that can bind CO2 in one oxidation state but not in another are immobilized onto the electrode substrates. These functionalized electrodes were incorporated into an electrochemical cell assembly to facilitate their cyclical electrochemical reduction and oxidation. The cells demonstrated exceptional capture and release of CO2 over more than 7000 cycles at 60â€“70% quinone utilization, 90% faradaic efficiency, and 90 kJ molâˆ’1 at 100% bed utilization and 43 kJ molâˆ’1 at 60%. A significant advantage of the quinone-functionalized electrodes is that they have a CO2 capacity that is essentially independent of the inlet feed concentration, in contrast to the capacities of sorbents typically used in PSA or TSA operations, where Langmuir-type equilibria limit capacity at lower concentrations.\n",
      "The strong performance of the electro-swing process allows for numerous applications where CO2 removal and/or storage is of interest. The ESA device can be easily integrated into processes in a plug-and-play fashion due to its simple design, and minimum requirement for ancillary equipment, primarily a regulated power source and sink (load). An initial techno-economic analysis (not reported here) shows that such carbon capture systems can be economically feasible with costs ranging from $50â€“$100 per tonne CO2 depending on the feed concentrations and applications under consideration.\n",
      "It is projected that further optimization of the ESA process can be obtained through refinement of the electrode chemistries and their assembly into compact adsorption devices to address a wide range of CO2 mitigation strategies.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Limited capacity: The system has a limited capacity for CO2 capture, as indicated by the rectangular adsorption isotherm. This limits the degree of regeneration of the adsorbent and the partial pressure of the recovered CO2 in the sweep stream.\n",
      "\n",

      "3. Energy losses during release: The release of CO2 from the system incurs energy losses due to the quasi-reversible nature of the reduction reaction in an electrophile-rich environment like CO2.

      "\n",
      "4. Partial release at high discharge potentials: High discharge potentials can result in partial release of CO2 due to the partial oxidation of the bis(carbonate) quinone units. This can lead to underutilization of anthraquinone and incomplete regeneration of the adsorption bed.\n",

While the first of the two electrochemical reactions in Scheme 2(b) is the same as that of Scheme 2(a), the second reaction has Q2âˆ’ as the reduced species and QË™âˆ’ as the species with higher oxidation number, with a standard reduction potential of E02. Likewise, in the anode oxidation reaction, Fc+ (ferrocenium) is the oxidized species and Fc (ferrocene) is the reduced species at E0 = âˆ’0.03 V. The current densities of these reactions were described by the Butlerâ€“Volmer equation,Â (7)where Î· is the overpotential and Î±, the symmetry factor, was approximated to be 0.5 for all the electrochemical reactions. The exchange current, i0, is given byÂ i0 = k0[red]Î±[ox](1âˆ’Î±)(8)The governing mass transfer equations for all the species involved in the electrochemical reaction, including the supporting electrolyte cations and anions, isÂ (9)where Ci is the concentration of the species, Ri is the rate of reaction in which the species is involved and Ni is the flux, which is zero for all immobilized faradaic species: anthraquinone in its different oxidation and binding states, and ferrocene. For mobile species, mainly the supporting electrolyte ions, the flux is given byÂ Ni = âˆ’Diâˆ‡Ci âˆ’ ziuiFCiâˆ‡Î¦(10)where zi is the valence, ui is the molar mobility, F is Faraday's constant and Î¦ is the electric potential. The current density can be obtained from the flux of charged mobile species in the electrolyteÂ (11)and the overall electroneutrality is maintained by ensuring thatÂ (12)The boundary conditions for these equations are ground (Î¦ = 0 V) for the anthraquinone electrode (colored grey in Fig. 9), and either constant current or constant potential at the ferrocene electrode (pink). The electrochemical model is the same for both sealed and flow systems, although the transport of CO2 in the gas phase (shown as a transparent block) is different in the two scenarios.\n",

      "In the sealed system, CO2 transport occurs via diffusion toward the electrode only, while in flow CO2 is also advected down the channel. In the sealed system, the partial pressure of the gas decreases during capture, while in flow the CO2 concentration changes along the gas channel with time, and the concentration of the gas leaving the device is a measure of the total effectiveness of the adsorption bed capacity and transport and kinetic limitations within the system. The total transport of CO2 is modelled by transport equations in each of the two phases, gas and IL. In the gas phase, the mass transfer governing equation in the sealed system is given byÂ (13)where CCO2,gas is the concentration of CO2 in the gas phase, obtained from its partial pressure and the ideal gas law. This governing equation has a no-flux boundary condition at the three wallsÂ (14)and at the gasâ€“IL interface, the fluxes normal to the interface are set to be equalÂ (15)where CCO2,IL is the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the IL phase. In the flow system, the flux of CO2 has an advective component as well and the governing equation becomesÂ (16)where u is the velocity of the gas flowing in the channel. The inlet is set at a constant concentration inflow and the outlet at zero gauge pressure. The mass transfer governing equation for dissolved CO2 in the IL phase, for both sealed and flow systems, is given byÂ (17)where R is a bulk reaction term describing the rate of the chemical reactions shown in Scheme 2(a). Simple rate equations, first order in all reactants, are used. A no-flux boundary condition is set at the walls. At the gasâ€“electrode interface, the concentration of dissolved CO2 is set toÂ CCO2,IL = Î²CCO2,gas(18)where Î² is the adjusted Henry's constant which accounts for the equilibrium partition of CO2 between the gas and IL phases.\n",

      "The simulation of constant-current charging at 0â€“5% CO2 concentrations in the sealed system in which the gas channel shown in Fig. 9 served as a gas headspace, shows results that are consistent with the aforementioned mechanism of CO2 capture. In addition to the cell voltage, the concentrations of all the cathode quinonic species were studied during the charging process. Fig. 10 shows the cell voltages at 0â€“5% CO2 and the concentration profiles of cathode species at 0, 2, and 5% CO2. The cell voltage profiles in Fig. 10(a) show that as the concentration of CO2 increases, less of the cell charging occurs at the higher potential. At 0% CO2 the cell simply traverses both reduction potentials of the quinone, and the species profiles in Fig. 10(b) show two consecutive conversions; the first is the reduction of quinone to semiquinone, and the second is the reduction of semiquinone to quinol dianion. The second reaction starts only after all the quinone is converted to semiquinone, and to further accommodate the incoming electrons at the constant current, the second, more energetic reduction takes place until all faradaic reactions are exhausted. Here, the simulation was stopped just short of full conversion to avoid numerical complications that arise from the exhaustion of faradaic material, i.e. complete charging. At 2% CO2, upon generation of the semiquinone, shown in Fig. 10(c), the modest diffusive flux of CO2 allows for the formation of the semiquinone monoadduct which soon accepts a second electron at the first reduction potential of quinone, hence extending the cell charging period spent at the lower potential. This dianion monoadduct can then react with a second CO2 molecule, to form the dianion diadduct. But, upon the depletion of CO2 in the vicinity of the cathode, due to a charging rate that is faster than the diffusive flux of CO2 into the electrolyte at 2% headspace concentration, the semiquinone is converted to the dianion at the higher second potential, while the concentrations of the dianion monoadduct and the dianion diadduct remain constant. This is reflected in the potential profile at 2% CO2 in Fig. 10(a). However, at 5% CO2, the diffusive flux of CO2 is adequate, and barely any semiquinone can be detected since it is converted to semiquinone monoadduct, and other subsequent species, soon after generation, shown in Fig. 10(d). Here, all the electrochemical reactions take place at the first potential and none of the semiquinone is converted to quinol dianion.\n",

      "Simulation of charging the electrochemical cell at different CO2 concentrations at constant current. (a) Potential difference of the cell. The change in concentration of quinone with charge is shown at (b) 0%, (c) 2% and (d) 5% CO2.\n",
      "Hence, the optimum charging method of the cell, i.e. CO2 capture, is to operate at a constant potential just larger than the first potential window Î”V1. The greater the charging voltage, the faster the reduction reaction due to the larger overpotential. For practical reasons, and to avoid large current surges, the cell can be charged at a constant current until the desired charging potential difference is reached. This will be between Î”V1 and Î”V2 based on the rate of charging desired. At this point the bed is activated for capture by making half the total capture capacity available. Then the cell can be set at that constant potential until saturation of the cathodes is achieved. The second half of the capture capacity is made available as more CO2 flows in.\n",
      "It is also possible to fully activate the bed by charging at a potential difference Î”VHigh > Î”V1, at which point the cells are disconnected and allowed to saturate with no further supply of current, until breakthrough is achieved, and the bed is regenerated by discharging the cell and releasing pure CO2. The energy recovered however, cannot exceed QÎ”V1, resulting in an energy loss of greater than Q(Î”VHigh âˆ’ Î”V1).\n",
      "Model results for flow system.\n",
      "The model described above was also used to simulate the capture of CO2 from a channel under flow conditions. The gas flowed parallel to the electrodes in the cell, a cross-section of which is shown in Fig. 9. The simulated concentration profiles in the channel and the quinone electrode are shown as a function of the number of bed volumes in Fig. 11(a). The gas phase profiles are consistent with a dispersed plug flow in the channels, with a reasonably sharp adsorption front, while the linear CO2 profiles in the electrode are a result of the significant diffusional limitations in this region. Of particular interest is the depletion of unbound quinonic species in the cathode as removal of CO2 from the channel proceeds; as the cathode becomes saturated with CO2, the concentration of CO2 increases along the length of the channel until breakthrough is achieved at around 8 bed volumes, after which further saturation is allowed until the outlet concentration is equal to the inlet concentration at around 10 bed volumes. Fig. 11(b) and (c) show the breakthrough profiles as a function of cell voltage for a given feed concentration, and of feed concentration for a given cell voltage, respectively. The number of bed volumes required increases with decreasing feed concentrations, a result of the fixed overall bed capacity and the rectangular nature of the adsorption isotherm of this system. In the absence of transport and reaction limitations, all breakthrough curves should collapse when the bed volume is multiplied by the feed fraction of the adsorbate; the fact that this is not exactly so in Fig. 11(d) indicates that mass transfer limitations do play a role in the uptake of CO2 by the activated electrodes. Nevertheless, the overall capacity, indicated by the trapezoidal area under Cout/Cin = 1 and the breakthrough curves, remained constant. However, the effect of a stronger driving force on improved mass transfer is evident in Fig. 11(b), where at charging potentials that are closer to Î”V2, more of the dianion is generated in a Nernstian distribution, which provides two reaction sites for CO2. This results in a stronger driving force in the adsorption of CO2 and hence improved mass transfer, which yields a sharper breakthrough profile.\n",

(d) Normalized breakthrough profiles of the capture experiments in (c). (e) The current across the electrochemical cells during the capture experiments in (b). (f) The current across the electrochemical cells during the capture experiments in (c).\n",
      "Fig. 11(e) and (f) show the current across the electrochemical cell during the capture experiments in (c) and (b) respectively. Fig. 11(e) shows that at low potential charging, i.e. 1.3 V, an initial spike in current is observed which results from the reduction of the quinones on the electrodes to semiquinone, as explained earlier. This is followed by a region of constant current which is proportional to the flux of CO2 into the electrodes, since it reacts with the semiquinones and allows them to accept a second electron at the low potential. As the electrodes become saturated and all the semiquinone is depleted, the current decreases. This region of constant current followed by the sharp decrease is very broad for the 10% case, but much shorter for the 50% case, where there is a brief transition from the initial spike to the decreasing current region manifested in a shoulder. However, Fig. 11(f) shows that as the applied capture potential increases, the current profile for the same inlet concentration changes dramatically. This is elucidated in Scheme 3; as the applied potential approaches Î”V2, all of the quinone is reduced to semiquinone and a Nernstian distribution of semiquinone and quinol dianion is generated, evident by the increasing current in the first peak.\n",
      "Scheme 3\n",
      "The reduction of anthraquinone at a potential higher than its second reduction potential with a limited flux of CO2.\n",
      "Thus, CO2 reacts with the Nernstian mixture of semiquinone and quinol dianion, where in the case of the latter no further reaction, chemical or electrochemical, occurs, but in the case of the former a semiquinone monoadduct species is formed, which can be reduced to the dianion monoadduct at Î”V1. Therefore, the applied potential presents a large overpotential for this reaction, hence the second increase in the current which corresponds to the electron transfer for this reduction. Following these steps, all the quinone moieties in the electrodes are in their doubly charged states and no further electron transfer occurs. This double peak behavior of the current is the result of the balance between the rate of electron transfer and the flux of CO2, which relates to the earlier discussions. At charging potentials higher than Î”V2e.g. Î”VHigh, not shown here, a larger first peak is expected where all the quinone is converted to semiquinone then dianion, i.e. two consecutive single-electron reductions, after which the current drops to zero and only chemical addition reactions occur, Scheme 2(b).\n",
      "Energetic analysis of CO2 release\n",
      "The applied release potential determines the energy recovered from the cell upon the release of CO2, and must, therefore, be selected carefully. While quinones under N2 are expected to be reduced and oxidized reversibly without any significant loss of energy, in an electrophile-rich environment, such as CO2, the reduction is only quasi-reversible due to the energetic penalty of breaking a bond formed with CO2. Therefore, some of the energy is lost in the process, and it is imperative to minimize this loss, since it is directly related to energy per mole of CO2 concentrated (captured and released) in a CO2 capture process. The last step in the CO2 capture, Scheme 1(b), i.e. the addition of a second molecule of CO2 to the semiquinone monoadduct to form a dianion diadduct, is chemically irreversible for the duration of the cycle,37 and the release reaction takes place via an electrochemical oxidation of the diadduct. This oxidation occurs at a more positive potential than the first reduction potential E01. Thus, the more positive the release potential, the larger the overpotential and the faster and more complete is the release of the bound CO2. However, a more positive release voltage corresponds to less energy recovered during discharge, and thus more work done per cycle of capture and release, which is given by eqn (2).\n",
      "Consequently, to reduce energy losses per cycle, a less positive potential can be used in a constant potential discharge. While the capture cell voltage can be maintained at fairly minimal levels by setting it close to Î”V1, with some diminishment in rate, release at high cell voltages can result in a partial release of CO2, due to the partial oxidation of the bis(carbonate) quinone units (dianion diadduct units), and a subsequent underutilization of anthraquinone. After a few cycles of capture and release at a higher potential, a constant equilibrium rate of utilization of anthraquinone is achieved. This is akin to the working capacity of a pressure-swing adsorption system.45 Thus partial release can be achieved at higher cell discharge potentials as shown in Fig. 12. This allows for a much smaller window of operation, which at the âˆ¼90% faradaic efficiency reported earlier, an energy use of âˆ¼43 kJ molâˆ’1, with 60% utilization of accessible quinone is possible. This is on par with other carbon capture systems in efficiency and energy consumption,46,47 including thermal swing systems.48\n",
      "Fig. 12\n",
      "Fraction of CO2 released from the PAQâ€“CNT electrode with release voltage. At a constant capture cell voltage of 1.3 V, less of the bed is recovered with increasing release cell voltage, but the energy per mole of CO2 captured and released also decreases.\n",
      "Solid sorbent materials used in carbon capture applications have enthalpies of CO2 adsorption of the same order, e.g., Metalâ€“Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with 30â€“50 kJ molâˆ’1 for some types of MOF-74,49 and âˆ¼100 kJ molâˆ’1 for some amine functionalized MOFs,50 or zeolites, such as 13X at 40 kJ molâˆ’1.51 However, these are not process energetics but rather enthalpies of adsorption. Therefore, processes which are designed to utilize these materials incur greater energetic penalties associated with the techniques used for delivering the energy for desorption, i.e. heat and pressure change, whereas the energetics reported herein correspond to that of the process, which unlike those utilizing solid sorbents, has a binary affinity for CO2.\n",
      "Moreover, if a precise rate of release is desired, the cell can be discharged at a constant current. In this case, the flux of the released CO2 is proportional to the current density, as given by eqn (3). The discharge current and time, control the charge transferred, which is the extensive variable in the work of the process. This method of release is seldom utilized in swing adsorption processes, because it is the intensive, rather than the extensive variable, that is modulated, e.g., temperature in thermal swing, pressure in pressure swing, and, here, potential. Nevertheless, this can be useful for fast regeneration of the bed at high currents, where long periods of capture and short periods of release are desired. But due to the incomplete discharge of the electrochemical cells, in analogy with high current discharge of batteries,30 the bed will only be partially regenerated.\n",
      "Swing operations\n",
      "The electro-swing adsorption (ESA) technology developed in this work has a number of perceived advantages over other swing technologies such as temperature- (TSA) and pressure-swing (PSA) adsorption in terms of both its mode of operation and its thermodynamic adsorption characteristics, as illustrated in Fig. 13. Temperature-swing operations require heating and cooling of the entire adsorption matrix to release the adsorbed compounds, rather than just targeting the adsorption sites themselves, which introduces many thermal inefficiencies to the operation. The heating is typically accomplished with high-temperature steam as the sweep gas, with subsequent condensation of the steam to recover the pure CO2 product stream, whereas cooling is achieved during the blowdown phase in preparation for the next sorption cycle. With pressure-swing operations, the release of the captured material occurs on reduction of the adsorbate partial pressure in the sweep to reverse the mass transfer driving force, which can be achieved either by drawing a vacuum on the bed, or by using low pressure steam as the sweep gas. The product leaving the bed is dilute, and requires a second separation step, such as the condensation of steam, and external compression of the resulting CO2 to bring it to the desired pressures for subsequent utilization or for transportation and subsurface sequestration in geologic formations. Moreover, in both TSA and PSA operations, the working capacity is strongly dependent on the shape of the Langmuir- (or Freundlich-) type isotherm, with significantly lower capacities at lower concentrations, which limits the degree of regeneration of the adsorbent, or the partial pressure of the recovered adsorbate in the sweep stream. The electro-swing adsorbents, on the other hand, are characterized by a rectangular adsorption isotherm in which the saturation loading capacity in the activated state is independent of the gas phase concentration, so the adsorbent is equally effective over a wide range of feed concentrations from ambient conditions through to those characteristic of large scale power and industrial facilities. When deactivated, the adsorbent has negligible capacity for the CO2 even at high CO2 gas phase concentrations such that the working capacity of the adsorbent is independent of operating conditions. Thus, the sweep stream during the desorption process can be pure CO2 at the desired pressure, subject primarily to equipment design constraints, which greatly simplifies the adsorption/desorption cycle relative to those of the TSA and PSA processes. The results in Fig. 6(a) show that release into a pure CO2 gas environment is facile and fast, and complete if sufficient time is allowed to account for the kinetics of the process.\n",

      "Conclusions\n",
      "The electro-swing operations outlined in this paper offer a new approach to the exploitation of electrochemically mediated complexation of CO2 with redox-active species for the mitigation of CO2 emissions, and for control of CO2 levels in confined environments. Electro-swing adsorption has been shown to be equally effective, at a constant capacity, for the capture of CO2 at concentrations typical of fossil fuel combustion flue gases (âˆ¼10%) and in confined ambient environments (0.6â€“0.8%). These advances have been made possible by the development of new electrode materials in which redox-active moieties, such as quinones, that can bind CO2 in one oxidation state but not in another are immobilized onto the electrode substrates. These functionalized electrodes were incorporated into an electrochemical cell assembly to facilitate their cyclical electrochemical reduction and oxidation. The cells demonstrated exceptional capture and release of CO2 over more than 7000 cycles at 60â€“70% quinone utilization, 90% faradaic efficiency, and 90 kJ molâˆ’1 at 100% bed utilization and 43 kJ molâˆ’1 at 60%. A significant advantage of the quinone-functionalized electrodes is that they have a CO2 capacity that is essentially independent of the inlet feed concentration, in contrast to the capacities of sorbents typically used in PSA or TSA operations, where Langmuir-type equilibria limit capacity at lower concentrations.\n",
      "The strong performance of the electro-swing process allows for numerous applications where CO2 removal and/or storage is of interest. The ESA device can be easily integrated into processes in a plug-and-play fashion due to its simple design, and minimum requirement for ancillary equipment, primarily a regulated power source and sink (load). An initial techno-economic analysis (not reported here) shows that such carbon capture systems can be economically feasible with costs ranging from $50â€“$100 per tonne CO2 depending on the feed concentrations and applications under consideration.\n",
      "It is projected that further optimization of the ESA process can be obtained through refinement of the electrode chemistries and their assembly into compact adsorption devices to address a wide range of CO2 mitigation strategies.\n",

      "Carbon capture is one of the foremost methods for curtailing greenhouse gas emissions. Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\n",

      "Below include all the problems to prioritize:\n",
      "Prioritized list of problems based on biggest bottleneck to increasing the approach's carbon capture efficiency:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Mass transfer limitations: The transport of CO2 into the porous electrode is the rate-limiting step in the carbon capture process. This can result in slower capture rates and broader breakthrough profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Variation in channel width: Imperfect packing of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to variation in channel width, causing uneven distribution of flow and overlapping breakthrough profiles.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. Electrode degradation: Over time, the electrochemical cells may experience degradation, resulting in a loss of capacity. This can be due to electromigration of shorter polymer chains from the electrode and into the electrolyte.\n",

      "5. Energy requirements: The energy required for the capture and release of CO2 can vary depending on the flux of CO2 and the rate of reduction of the quinones. Lower CO2 fluxes can result in higher energy requirements.\n",

      "6. Channeling effects: Improper assembly of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to channeling, where some channels bypass the active cells. This can result in lower overall efficiency and incomplete capture of CO2.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Sensitivity to oxygen: The presence of oxygen in the feed stream can cause oxidation of the reduced quinones, reducing the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system. Careful tuning of the electron density of the quinone polymer is required to avoid reactions with oxygen.\n",

      "1. Mass transfer limitations: The transport of CO2 into the porous electrode is the rate-limiting step in the carbon capture process. This can result in slower capture rates and broader breakthrough profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Variation in channel width: Imperfect packing of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to variation in channel width, causing uneven distribution of flow and overlapping breakthrough profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Sluggish electron transfer: The CVs of the polyanthraquinone-carbon nanotube (PAQ-CNT) composite electrodes show sluggish electron transfer, which can affect the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Electrode degradation: Over time, the electrochemical cells may experience degradation, resulting in a loss of capacity. This can be due to electromigration of shorter polymer chains from the electrode and into the electrolyte.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Energy requirements: The energy required for the capture and release of CO2 can vary depending on the flux of CO2 and the rate of reduction of the quinones. Lower CO2 fluxes can result in higher energy requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Channeling effects: Improper assembly of the electrochemical cells in the flow device can lead to channeling, where some channels bypass the active cells. This can result in lower overall efficiency and incomplete capture of CO2.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Sensitivity to oxygen: The presence of oxygen in the feed stream can cause oxidation of the reduced quinones, reducing the overall efficiency of the carbon capture system. Careful tuning of the electron density of the quinone polymer is required to avoid reactions with oxygen.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Complex flow systems: The electrochemical cell system eliminates the need for complex flow systems, but the assembly and design of the contactor bed can still be challenging and require careful optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. Limited capacity: The capacity of the electrochemical cells and contactor bed is limited by the amount of quinone material and the overall size of the system. Scaling up the system may require additional optimization and engineering considerations.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Limited applicability: The electrochemical cell system may not be suitable for all carbon capture applications, as it is primarily designed for capturing CO2 from flue gas and other CO2-rich streams. Other carbon capture scenarios, such as removing CO2 from enclosed spaces or low concentration streams, may require different approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Limited capacity: The system has a limited capacity for CO2 capture, as indicated by the rectangular adsorption isotherm. This limits the degree of regeneration of the adsorbent and the partial pressure of the recovered CO2 in the sweep stream.\n",

      "13. Energy losses during release: The release of CO2 from the system incurs energy losses due to the quasi-reversible nature of the reduction reaction in an electrophile-rich environment like CO2. The more positive the release potential, the larger the overpotential and the faster the release, but the less energy is recovered during discharge.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. Partial release at high discharge potentials: High discharge potentials can result in partial release of CO2 due to the partial oxidation of the bis(carbonate) quinone units. This can lead to underutilization of anthraquinone and incomplete regeneration of the adsorption bed.\n",
      "\n",

      "17. Durability concerns: The durability of the electrochemical cells used in the system is reported to show <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cycles. While this is promising, further studies are needed to assess the long-term durability and stability of the cells under various operating conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "18. Energy consumption: The reported energy use for the system ranges from 43 to 90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, depending on the bed utilization and release potential. While this is on par with other carbon capture systems, further optimization is needed to reduce energy consumption and make the system more efficient.\n",
      "\n",

Techno-economic feasibility: While an initial techno-economic analysis suggests that the carbon capture system can be economically feasible with costs ranging from $50-$100 per tonne of CO2, further analysis and optimization are needed to assess the economic viability of the system for different applications and feed concentrations.\n",

    "Carbon capture is one of the foremost methods for curtailing greenhouse gas emissions. Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\n",

Incumbent technologies are inherently inefficient due to thermal energy losses, large footprint, or degradation of sorbent material. We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30% loss of capacity after 7000 cylces.\n",

A number of different cells were constructed in the flow bed configuration shown in Fig. 7(b). The exposed area of a typical cell was 18 cm × 10 cm, with ∼0.2 g of P14AQ–CNT composite; at ∼70% useful quinones, this amounted to the adsorption of ∼9–14 cm3 of CO2. The channels between the cells were typically ∼500 μm thick, and bed volumes were about 35 cm3 with a total bed weight of ∼1.5 g bringing the productivity of the bed to 0.01–0.02 kg CO2 per kgbedtb, where tb is the breakthrough time, i.e. the time to reach saturation of the electrodes or for the outlet CO2 concentration to begin to increase. At feed flow rates of ∼10 mL min−1 and 15% CO2, this productivity is on par with the TSA systems reported by Ntiamoah et al.36\n",

      "It can be shown that axial flow dispersion within individual channels was minimal at most flow rates, and that the transport resistances resided primarily within the electrodes. Imperfect packing of the cells in the flow device by hand did, in some cases, lead to significant channeling and large-scale device axial dispersion, however, with broad breakthrough curves, but it is anticipated that under optimal manufacturing conditions these effects can be reduced significantly.\n",
      "The chronoamperometric experiments performed in the sealed system were repeated in a flow system. Mixtures of N2 and CO2 at different compositions were flown past the stack of assembled electrochemical cells. Upon reduction of the PAQ–CNT electrodes, CO2 was removed (captured) from the inlet stream, and the decrease in the concentration of CO2 was detected at the outlet stream. In these experiments the bed was fully activated by charging at a constant potential greater than ΔV22 to guarantee the complete reduction of the all accessible quinone units prior to adsorption. Experiments with an initial half activation, i.e., at ΔV1, followed by adsorption at constant potential, did not result in different breakthrough curves, mainly because the kinetics of the reduction and the adsorption reactions are much faster than the rates of mass transfer of CO2 into the film, as discussed later.\n",
      "The breakthrough profiles obtained for one flow system are shown in Fig. 8(a). Breakthrough was achieved at smaller bed volumes of gas treated for higher feed CO2 concentrations, where the bed volume is a time measure which represents the total volume of gas treated at any given time relative to the volume of the bed itself. The breakthrough curves superimpose when normalized by the inlet CO2 concentration, shown in Fig. 8(b), which indicates a consistent behavior of the bed, i.e. equal utilization of the overall adsorption capacity regardless of the inlet concentration, an indication of a rectangular equilibrium isotherm. Note in this particular module that, although the breakthrough curves themselves were sharp, prior to breakthrough there was a consistent effluent concentration of 20% of the feed concentration, the result of a bypassing of the active cells by 20% of the total gas flow. The overall capacity of the bed can be calculated from the area between the line at Cout/Cin = 1 and the normalized breakthrough curve. A contactor bed of a desired overall capacity can be designed by linear scaling from this overall capacity. With a larger bed, CO2 was fully captured from a stream at 10% inlet concentration, which is on the higher end for carbon capture applications as it mimics combustion exhaust. Up to 10 bed volumes of feed were treated before breakthrough was achi\n",

      "Mizen and Wrighton first demonstrated the reductive addition of CO2 to 9,10-phenanthrenequinone in aprotic electrolytes. Quinones undergo two reversible one-electron reductions in aprotic electrolytes, at two reduction potentials, as shown in Scheme 1(a) for anthraquinone. But in the presence of CO2, a single two-electron quasi-reversible reduction takes place at the first reduction potential, as shown in Scheme 1(b), where the CO2 molecule carboxylates the quinone resulting in a carbonate salt.37 Upon the first reduction of a quinone molecule, a semiquinone radical anion is produced. Some semiquinones, with sufficient electron density, i.e. sufficient Lewis base strength, can react with CO2 in a nucleophilic addition to form a carbonate salt. Semiquinones with lower electron density – due to attached electron withdrawing groups – do not have the nucleophilic strength to react with CO2.38 A semiquinone carboxylated by the reductive addition of CO2 has its negative charge isolated from the rest of the molecule by a σ-bond, rendering the carboxylated quinone aromatic ring(s) relatively neutral. Hence, the two-electron reduction of the parent quinone under CO2 occurs at the first reduction potential. The second reduction generates another nucleophilic center, i.e. the second oxygen of the quinone, which reacts with a second CO2 molecule to form a bis(carbonate) dianion salt – the quinol dianion diadduct.

      " mainly because the hydrophobicity of the IL used presents a considerable mass transfer resistance for water with very little retention,40 and any residual water in the IL phase merely stabilizes the reduced quinones,41 with no significant change to the electrochemical or chemical steps of the carbon capture process.20 While the presence of oxygen can cause the oxidation of some reduced quinones with a sufficiently negative reduction potential, through the formation of the superoxide radical anion O2˙−, it is possible to avoid any reactions with oxygen in the feed stream by carefully tuning the electron density of the quinone polymer.42\n",
      "The cyclic voltammogram (CV) of the PAQ–CNT composite on the electrode substrate in [Bmim][TF2N] saturated with N2, the green line in Fig. 3, shows two redox couples corresponding to the two reduction potentials of anthraquinone. The cathodic and anodic peaks, however, are broader than those reported for solutions of quinone molecules in electrolytes,20 which can be ascribed to the slower electron exchange between differently-reduced redox units, i.e. neutral quinone, semiquinone (radical anion) and quinol dianion, along the π-conjugated backbone of the polymer,43 and also to the diffusion and electromigration of electrolytic species into and out of the porous PAQ–CNT film.44 The expected disappearance of the second redox couple of the CV under CO2 was observed, as shown by the red line in Fig. 3, and attributed to the carboxylation of the reduced quinone units along the polymer chain facilitating the second electron reduction of anthraquinone at the first reduction potential, with the consequent increase in the current at that potential. The PAQ–CNT electrode can therefore be used to remove CO2 selectively from a gas mixture via nucleophilic addition, and regenerated via an electrochemical oxidation, with release of the CO2, as shown earlier. The two reduction potentials under N2 are E01 = −1.21 V and E02 = −1.63 V, vs. Fc. Under CO2 these two potentials coalesce to yield a single quasi-reversible redox couple at the first reduction potential observed under N2, i.e. E01.\n",
      "The separation of the oxidation and reduction peaks in the CVs reported is large, indicating sluggish electron transfer to the quinone repeat units on the polymer, and a thick diffusion layer in the porous electrode.44 While the ratio of polymer to CNT was optimized for the greatest gravimetric capacity, it is not the ideal ratio for conductivity. Some of the conductivity takes place through the backbone of the polymer, which contributes to the slow electron transfer. This, however, does not present a problem in the design of the contactor separation unit, since the rate limiting step in the CO2 capture process is the transport of CO2 and not electron transfer.\n",

      "CO2 deprivation was not a problem in the highly saturated electrolyte in the CV electrochemical characterizations, where the concentration of CO2 in the electrolyte was about 20 times higher than that of the quinones on the electrode. However, in an adsorption system, where the electrolyte is not saturated with CO2 there needs to be a careful balance between the advective and diffusive fluxes of CO2 towards the anthraquinone cathodes for reductive addition, and the rate of the reduction of anthraquinone. This can be better controlled by charging the cell, i.e. reducing the anthraquinone, at a constant potential that is sufficient to drive the first reduction of anthraquinone but not the second, i.e. charging the cell at a potential difference that is between ΔV1 and ΔV2. With operation at this constant potential, the flux of CO2 does not affect the energy of binding, since the second electron is acquired by a semiquinone at the first reduction potential, but only after the first CO2 addition occurs; following this second reduction, a second CO2 molecule can bind to the dianion monoadduct. When the first reduction is allowed in a CO2-lean environment at a constant potential, the current observed after the initial surge, which results from the first reduction, is proportional to the flux of CO2 towards the anthraquinone electrode. Nevertheless, this current ultimately diminishes due to the decrease in the number of semiquinones available to react with CO2.

      "The simulation of constant-current charging at 0–5% CO2 concentrations in the sealed system in which the gas channel shown in Fig. 9 served as a gas headspace, shows results that are consistent with the aforementioned mechanism of CO2 capture. In addition to the cell voltage, the concentrations of all the cathode quinonic species were studied during the charging process. Fig. 10 shows the cell voltages at 0–5% CO2 and the concentration profiles of cathode species at 0, 2, and 5% CO2. The cell voltage profiles in Fig. 10(a) show that as the concentration of CO2 increases, less of the cell charging occurs at the higher potential. At 0% CO2 the cell simply traverses both reduction potentials of the quinone, and the species profiles in Fig. 10(b) show two consecutive conversions; the first is the reduction of quinone to semiquinone, and the second is the reduction of semiquinone to quinol dianion. The second reaction starts only after all the quinone is converted to semiquinone, and to further accommodate the incoming electrons at the constant current, the second, more energetic reduction takes place until all faradaic reactions are exhausted. Here, the simulation was stopped just short of full conversion to avoid numerical complications that arise from the exhaustion of faradaic material, i.e. complete charging. At 2% CO2, upon generation of the semiquinone, shown in Fig. 10(c), the modest diffusive flux of CO2 allows for the formation of the semiquinone monoadduct which soon accepts a second electron at the first reduction potential of quinone, hence extending the cell charging period spent at the lower potential. This dianion monoadduct can then react with a second CO2 molecule, to form the dianion diadduct. But, upon the depletion of CO2 in the vicinity of the cathode, due to a charging rate that is faster than the diffusive flux of CO2 into the electrolyte at 2% headspace concentration, the semiquinone is converted to the dianion at the higher second potential, while the concentrations of the dianion monoadduct and the dianion diadduct remain constant. This is reflected in the potential profile at 2% CO2 in Fig. 10(a). However, at 5% CO2, the diffusive flux of CO2 is adequate, and barely any semiquinone can be detected since it is converted to semiquinone monoadduct, and other subsequent species, soon after generation, shown in Fig. 10(d).

      "The model described above was also used to simulate the capture of CO2 from a channel under flow conditions. The gas flowed parallel to the electrodes in the cell, a cross-section of which is shown in Fig. 9. The simulated concentration profiles in the channel and the quinone electrode are shown as a function of the number of bed volumes in Fig. 11(a). The gas phase profiles are consistent with a dispersed plug flow in the channels, with a reasonably sharp adsorption front, while the linear CO2 profiles in the electrode are a result of the significant diffusional limitations in this region. Of particular interest is the depletion of unbound quinonic species in the cathode as removal of CO2 from the channel proceeds; as the cathode becomes saturated with CO2, the concentration of CO2 increases along the length of the channel until breakthrough is achieved at around 8 bed volumes, after which further saturation is allowed until the outlet concentration is equal to the inlet concentration at around 10 bed volumes. Fig. 11(b) and (c) show the breakthrough profiles as a function of cell voltage for a given feed concentration, and of feed concentration for a given cell voltage, respectively. The number of bed volumes required increases with decreasing feed concentrations, a result of the fixed overall bed capacity and the rectangular nature of the adsorption isotherm of this system. In the absence of transport and reaction limitations, all breakthrough curves should collapse when the bed volume is multiplied by the feed fraction of the adsorbate; the fact that this is not exactly so in Fig. 11(d) indicates that mass transfer limitations do play a role in the uptake of CO2 by the activated electrodes. Nevertheless, the overall capacity, indicated by the trapezoidal area under Cout/Cin = 1 and the breakthrough curves, remained constant. However, the effect of a stronger driving force on improved mass transfer is evident in Fig. 11(b), where at charging potentials that are closer to ΔV2, more of the dianion is generated in a Nernstian distribution, which provides two reaction sites for CO2. This results in a stronger driving force in the adsorption of CO2 and hence improved mass transfer, which yields a sharper breakthrough profile.\n",

The simulated concentration profiles in the channel and the quinone electrode are shown as a function of the number of bed volumes in Fig. 11(a). The gas phase profiles are consistent with a dispersed plug flow in the channels, with a reasonably sharp adsorption front, while the linear CO2 profiles in the electrode are a result of the significant diffusional limitations in this region. Of particular interest is the depletion of unbound quinonic species in the cathode as removal of CO2 from the channel proceeds; as the cathode becomes saturated with CO2, the concentration of CO2 increases along the length of the channel until breakthrough is achieved at around 8 bed volumes, after which further saturation is allowed until the outlet concentration is equal to the inlet concentration at around 10 bed volumes. Fig. 11(b) and (c) show the breakthrough profiles as a function of cell voltage for a given feed concentration, and of feed concentration for a given cell voltage, respectively. The number of bed volumes required increases with decreasing feed concentrations, a result of the fixed overall bed capacity and the rectangular nature of the adsorption isotherm of this system. In the absence of transport and reaction limitations, all breakthrough curves should collapse when the bed volume is multiplied by the feed fraction of the adsorbate; the fact that this is not exactly so in Fig. 11(d) indicates that mass transfer limitations do play a role in the uptake of CO2 by the activated electrodes.

Therefore, processes which are designed to utilize these materials incur greater energetic penalties associated with the techniques used for delivering the energy for desorption, i.e. heat and pressure change, whereas the energetics reported herein correspond to that of the process, which unlike those utilizing solid sorbents, has a binary affinity for CO2.\n",

The discharge current and time, control the charge transferred, which is the extensive variable in the work of the process. This method of release is seldom utilized in swing adsorption processes, because it is the intensive, rather than the extensive variable, that is modulated, e.g., temperature in thermal swing, pressure in pressure swing, and, here, potential.

Temperature-swing operations require heating and cooling of the entire adsorption matrix to release the adsorbed compounds, rather than just targeting the adsorption sites themselves, which introduces many thermal inefficiencies to the operation. The heating is typically accomplished with high-temperature steam as the sweep gas, with subsequent condensation of the steam to recover the pure CO2 product stream, whereas cooling is achieved during the blowdown phase in preparation for the next sorption cycle. With pressure-swing operations, the release of the captured material occurs on reduction of the adsorbate partial pressure in the sweep to reverse the mass transfer driving force, which can be achieved either by drawing a vacuum on the bed, or by using low pressure steam as the sweep gas. The product leaving the bed is dilute, and requires a second separation step, such as the condensation of steam, and external compression of the resulting CO2 to bring it to the desired pressures for subsequent utilization or for transportation and subsurface sequestration in geologic formations.

Temperature-swing operations require heating and cooling of the entire adsorption matrix to release the adsorbed compounds, rather than just targeting the adsorption sites themselves, which introduces many thermal inefficiencies to the operation. The heating is typically accomplished with high-temperature steam as the sweep gas, with subsequent condensation of the steam to recover the pure CO2 product stream, whereas cooling is achieved during the blowdown phase in preparation for the next sorption cycle. With pressure-swing operations, the release of the captured material occurs on reduction of the adsorbate partial pressure in the sweep to reverse the mass transfer driving force, which can be achieved either by drawing a vacuum on the bed, or by using low pressure steam as the sweep gas. The product leaving the bed is dilute, and requires a second separation step, such as the condensation of steam, and external compression of the resulting CO2 to bring it to the desired pressures for subsequent utilization or for transportation and subsurface sequestration in geologic formations.

      "The electro-swing operations outlined in this paper offer a new approach to the exploitation of electrochemically mediated complexation of CO2 with redox-active species for the mitigation of CO2 emissions, and for control of CO2 levels in confined environments. Electro-swing adsorption has been shown to be equally effective, at a constant capacity, for the capture of CO2 at concentrations typical of fossil fuel combustion flue gases (∼10%) and in confined ambient environments (0.6–0.8%). These advances have been made possible by the development of new electrode materials in which redox-active moieties, such as quinones, that can bind CO2 in one oxidation state but not in another are immobilized onto the electrode substrates. These functionalized electrodes were incorporated into an electrochemical cell assembly to facilitate their cyclical electrochemical reduction and oxidation. The cells demonstrated exceptional capture and release of CO2 over more than 7000 cycles at 60–70% quinone utilization, 90% faradaic efficiency, and 90 kJ mol−1 at 100% bed utilization and 43 kJ mol−1 at 60%. A significant advantage of the quinone-functionalized electrodes is that they have a CO2 capacity that is essentially independent of the inlet feed concentration, in contrast to the capacities of sorbents typically used in PSA or TSA operations, where Langmuir-type equilibria limit capacity at lower concentrations.\n",

      "erlin. The electron high tension was between 3–6 kV, and the high efficiency secondary electron (HE-SE2) detector was used in an analytic column mode. Diluted suspensions of P14AQ–CNT (0.1 mg mL−1) were dropcast onto holey-carbon transmission electron microscopy (TEM) grid for imaging using HR-TEM, JEOL 2010 Advanced High Performance TEM.\n",

      "Mixtures of N2 and CO2 were made for the sealed chamber batch and the open flow capture and release experiments. These were made by controlling the flow rates using Aalborg Mass Flow Controller GFC-17 (0–50 mL min−1) for the CO2 and (0–50 mL min−1) for the N2 for experiments with >5% CO2 and (0–1000 mL min−1) for experiments with <5% CO2.\n",
      "Sealed chamber capture and release.\n",
      "The electrochemical cell(s) were placed in an insulating sealed chamber that was charged with different CO2 concentrations (with nitrogen as the balance) at ∼1 atm and ∼21 °C by purging for 2 h. Potential difference was applied across the power feed-throughs that were connected to the electrochemical cells, and the decrease and increase in pressure in the chamber, upon capture and release, respectively, was monitored using a Omega® PXM409-USBH pressure transducer with a range of 0–15 psia and an accuracy of 0.08% BSL.\n",
      "Flow capture and release experiments.\n",
      "The assembled electrochemical cells were stacked in a flow cell with the P14AQ–CNT electrode sides tracing parallel passages. The stack of these cells, separated by ∼500 μm, was placed in a gas flow chamber (the experimental setup) and gas was flown past them. Mixtures of nitrogen and carbon dioxide at ∼10 mL min−1 and various inlet concentrations of CO2 at T ∼ 21 °C were studied. The bed volume of the system was 70 cm3. The concentration of CO2 in the mixture at the outlet was measured using CO2-Meter SprintIR® with an accuracy of 100 ppm.\n",

      "FIVE WHYS TO UNDERSTAND AN APPROACH'S MAIN FINDINGS: \n",
      " 1. Why was the research conducted?\n",
      "The research was conducted to find solutions for the environmental problem of increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, which causes climate change and global warming. The goal was to explore negative emissions technologies, specifically direct air capture (DAC), as a means to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and potentially achieve net negative global emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Why is DAC considered an important technology?\n",
      "DAC is considered important because it offers several advantages. It is independent of CO2 source location, as CO2 is distributed homogeneously throughout the atmosphere. It can tackle emissions from the transport sector and other small sources. DAC is also versatile and can be used for long-term storage and sequestration of CO2 (DACCS) or for short-term utilization in chemical processes (DACCU). Additionally, DAC contributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals and does not require arable land.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Why are absorption and adsorption technologies the most studied in DAC?\n",
      "Absorption and adsorption technologies are the most studied in DAC because they are mature and well-established technologies. They have been extensively analyzed in the literature and offer promising potential for CO2 capture from the air. These technologies have been used in various applications and industries, making them a focus of research and development in the field of DAC.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Why are thermodynamic issues significant in DAC?\n",
      "Thermodynamic issues are significant in DAC because they determine the minimum amount of energy required for CO2 separation from the air. The dilute nature of CO2 in the atmosphere, with a partial pressure about 350 times lower than coal flue gas, necessitates the processing of large volumes of air to capture a significant amount of CO2. This results in high energy and cost requirements for DAC systems. Understanding and addressing these thermodynamic challenges is crucial for improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of DAC technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Why is reducing costs and improving efficiency important for large-scale DAC deployment?\n",
      "Reducing costs and improving efficiency are important for large-scale DAC deployment because they are key factors in making the technology economically viable and scalable. Lowering the cost of DAC systems would make them more accessible and attractive for widespread implementation. Improving efficiency would reduce the energy requirements and associated costs, making DAC more sustainable and economically feasible. These efforts are necessary to accelerate the development and deployment of DAC at a large scale to achieve significant CO2 reduction and negative emissions.\n",

In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\n",

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone–hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35 nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, comparable to 530 mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90 mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications.

These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35 nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, comparable to 530 mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90 mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications.

Introduction\\nRecent estimates report that CO 2emissions in the world were more than 33 Gton in\\n2018 [ 1]. In order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, several international agreements\\nwere signed: the Conference of the Parties (COP21) held at Paris on the 12 December 2015\\nwas a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\\n2/1.5\\x0eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was conﬁrmed\\nby the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\\nnational determined contribution (NDC) was deﬁned [ 3]. However, in order to achieve this\\nobjective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\\nnot enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\\nFor this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\\nremoval (CDR) technologies, will have a crucial role in the coming years to achieve the\\nCO 2level deﬁned by the environmental agreements and stabilize the CO 2concentration\\nbetween 350 and 440 ppm [6,7].\\nNegative emissions technologies are deﬁned as the intentional human effort to remove\\nCO 2emissions from the atmosphere and include the following: afforestation and reforesta-\\ntion (AR), soil carbon sequestration (SCS), biochar (BC), bioenergy with carbon capture and\\nstorage (BECCS), direct air capture (DAC), enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization\\n(EW) and ocean fertilization (OF) [ 8]. Among these solutions, the research community has\\nbeen focused for the most part on DAC, due to its advantages [9].\\nDAC was used for decades to produce CO 2-free air to support life in submarines and\\nspacecraft systems [ 10,11]; it was presented by Lackner as a GHG mitigation technology\\nonly in 1999 [ 12].

In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\\nTerms & Conditions\\nMost electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.

Third, the triple-phase boundary created at \\nthe cathode of our solid-electrolyte reactor allows for rapid diffu -\\nsion of CO2 in the gas phase towards the catalyst–membrane inter -\\nface26–28, enabling the reactor to operate under large current densities \\nfor fast CO2 capture while still maintaining high Faradaic efficiencies. \\nThis is different from the traditional pH-swing method, in which the \\nliquid-phase mass diffusion limits the rates of CO2 adsorption (through \\ngas–liquid contact). Fourth, the capture system can take advantage \\nof past advancements in fuel cells and water-splitting catalysts for \\nhigh energy efficiencies and easy scalability. Finally, our PSE device \\nenables a continuous, simultaneous and integrated carbon-capture \\nand release process, which differs from traditional absorption/desorp -\\ntion cycles and simplifies the carbon-capture system for many on-site \\napplications (Fig.\\xa0 1d).Concept verification\\nTo validate the proposed CO2-capture mechanism, we used commercial \\nPt/C and IrO2 as the electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, respectively29. \\nDifferent CO2:O2 ratios were used to establish a fundamental under -\\nstanding of the intrinsic CO2-separation performance of the system \\n(Methods and Supplementary Figs.\\xa02 and 3). As shown in Fig.\\xa02a, the \\nORR/OER I–V curves under different CO2 concentrations were similar, \\nsuggesting that the O2 concentration instead of the CO2 concentration \\ndetermines the cell activity.

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone–hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35\\xa0nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520\\xa0mV at a current density of 10\\xa0mA\\xa0cm−2, comparable to 530\\xa0mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90\\xa0mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications.

      "2018 [ 1]. In order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, several international agreements\n",
      "were signed: the Conference of the Parties (COP21) held at Paris on the 12 December 2015\n",
      "was a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\n",
      "2/1.5\u000eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was conﬁrmed\n",
      "by the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\n",
      "national determined contribution (NDC) was deﬁned [ 3]. However, in order to achieve this\n",
      "objective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\n",
      "not enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\n",
      "For this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\n",
      "removal (CDR) technologies, will have a crucial role in the coming years to achieve the\n",

      "Recent estimates report that CO 2emissions in the world were more than 33 Gton in\n",
      "2018 [ 1]. In order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, several international agreements\n",
      "were signed: the Conference of the Parties (COP21) held at Paris on the 12 December 2015\n",
      "was a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\n",
      "2/1.5\u000eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was conﬁrmed\n",
      "by the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\n",
      "national determined contribution (NDC) was deﬁned [ 3]. However, in order to achieve this\n",
      "objective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\n",
      "not enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\n",
      "For this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\n",
      "removal (CDR) technologies, will have a crucial role in the coming years to achieve the\n",

      "Get e-AlertsAbstractCurrent methods for CO2 capture and concentration (CCC) are energy intensive due to their reliance on thermal cycles, which are intrinsically Carnot limited in efficiency. In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\n",

      "Get e-AlertsAbstractCurrent methods for CO2 capture and concentration (CCC) are energy intensive due to their reliance on thermal cycles, which are intrinsically Carnot limited in efficiency. In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\n",

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone–hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35 nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, comparable to 530 mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90 mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications. To study the interface, thin films of a PPy/[Sn(dmit)3]2 were electrochemically grown with the aid of a microcell typically used in scanning tunneling microscopy assays. Raman and FTIR spectroscopies showed the effect of dimensionality on those materials, especially on the vibrational modes of dmit ring and on the 75 nm thick PPy/[Sn (dmit)3]2 film, which presents an optimized polymer chain conjunction length and a 20 % greater contribution to the polaron charge carriers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed the polaron/bipolaron ratio data, allowing us to determine other contributions to the surface charge density. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images show the hybrid thin film's different growth modes and the roughness evolution as a function of the electrochemical signal used in the synthesis.Acetylcholinesterase modified inkjet-printed graphene/gold nanoparticle/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) hybrid electrode for ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection2023, BioelectrochemistryShow abstractThis study successfully created a portable acetylcholinesterase sensor on a printed hybrid electrode capable of detecting chlorpyrifos in the field. While a screen-printed electrode was chosen herein to enable a single-use and portable platform for the in-field application, the hybrid material was incorporated to ensure ultrasensitive detection at lower electrode potentials. The hybrid ink of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated on graphene (GP) sheets in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was synthesized through a simple completely-green one-pot process. The subsequent characterization was carried out via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The synergy resulting from the greater surface area and enhanced transfer of electrons combined with high levels of electrocatalytic activity and superb conductivity offered by GP, AuNP, and PEDOT:PSS allows the sensor to exhibit ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection at the relatively low detection limit of 0.07 nM. The sensor demonstrated in this study also exhibits good reproducibility, desirable stability, and a successful application for the real sample with satisfactory recovery results of around 106 %, indicating its potential for use as a tool in the analysis of pesticides.Enzyme based bioelectrocatalysis over laccase immobilized poly-thiophene supported carbon fiber paper for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone2022, Molecular CatalysisShow abstractA modified electrode based on laccase immobilized poly-thiophene-3-carboxylic acid supported on carbon fiber paper was developed for the electrocatalytic oxidation of D-ribofuranose to otherwise difficult-to-access D-ribonolactone, a precursor for C-nucleoside based drug like Remdesivir. The electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuranose was achieved by the TEMPO-mediated electrochemical process. The experimental parameters were optimized and validated using Design of Experiment (DoE) statistical tool indicating the concentration of TEMPO and stirring as important parameters in bulk electrolysis. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuronose followed single electron anodic oxidation of TEMPO mediated by laccase to the corresponding oxoammonium nitrosonium species which was vital for the mediated electrochemical oxidation. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation was established using cyclic voltammetry and computational studies. The plausible interactions of laccase enzyme with TEMPO mediator were studied using molecular docking experiments. This facile method was successfully applied for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone.Electropolymerized melamine for simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine2020, Food ChemistryShow abstractPoly(melamine) (PMel) was synthesized via the electropolymerization of melamine monomer, which was then characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The possible polymerization mechanisms of melamine were also revealed by FT-IR spectroscopy and UV–Vis spectroscopy. Next, the PMel modified GCE (PMel/GCE) was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite (NO2−) and tartrazine, and the parameters were optimized. The kinetic study showed that the electrochemical oxidation of nitrite and tartrazine at the surface of PMel/GCE is a typical surface-controlled electrode process. Under the optimun conditions, the developed sensor outperformed those previously reported, and it also exhibited high selectivity and reproducibility. Finally, the PMel/GCE was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine in foodstuffs, and the results indicated that the proposed sensor could be a promising candidate for accurate determination of nitrite and tartrazine in real food samples.The role of electrolytically deposited palladium and platinum metal nanoparticles dispersed onto poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene) for enhanced glucose electrooxidation in biofuel cells2020, Electrochimica ActaShow abstractGlucose biofuel cells are one of the promising power supplies with a competent long-term stability and power density. In this respect, catalysts of palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) metal nanoparticles film coated electrode were fabricated for biofuel cell. The Pt and Pd particles were electrochemically deposited onto glassy carbon (GC) electrode modified with poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene), (p-1,8-DAN), via single or layer-by-layer electrodeposition. In results, Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC and Pd-Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC shell-core catalysts were fabricated and characterized by several analytical techniques such as AFM, EDX,SEM, TEM, and XPS, in addition to electrochemical methods. Their catalytic electrooxidation behaviors of glucose were investigated in alkaline medium. The as-prepared nano-catalysts showed improved electrocatalytic performances and better stability for glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) due to the presence of metal nanoparticles. The Pd as core and Pt as shell in Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC catalyst exhibited higher electrochemically accessible surface area (157.58 m2/g) and a favored electrooxidation efficiency. Moreover, the bimetallic Pt-Pd shell-core electrode showed higher resistance to poisoning (tolerance 1.24) and a decrease in the onset potential to -0.28 V. These multipurpose electro-catalysts are a potential candidate for developing a novel glucose biofuel cell.View all citing articles on ScopusResearch articleRecent advances in the synthesis of conducting polymers from the vapour phaseProgress in Materials Science, Volume 86, 2017, pp. 127-146Show abstractInherently conducting polymers (ICPs) combine the electrical properties of metals and semiconductors with a polymer’s ability to flex and/or stretch. In general, polymers are relatively simple to synthesise, however, ICPs themselves have had limited uptake in consumer devices. This lack of uptake is in part related to the insolubility of many ICPs in common industrial solvents, and hence methods to manufacture them in a usable form have been problematic. Vapour phase polymerisation (VPP) is one method that provides a convenient route to producing thin films of both soluble and insoluble ICPs, and nanocomposites thereof. In this critical review the VPP process will be discussed from the fundamental viewpoint of the proposed polymerisation mechanism and the parameters affecting polymer growth for a range of different monomers (thiophene, 3-hexylthiophene, pyrrole, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, etc.). Looking forward into the future, new areas of polymer design and fabrication using VPP will be discussed, such as the enhancement of ICPs through additives, and next generation device fabrication based upon VPP ICPs.Research articleConducting polymeric nanocomposites: A review in solar fuel applicationsFuel, Volume 325, 2022, Article 124899Show abstractOver the last few decades, research is being carried out in the field of photocatalysis to investigate for fuels production in sustainable manner. Due to an energy depletion and CO2 emission in the current situation urge us to produce alternative fuels. Water splitting and the reduction of carbon dioxide using various photocatalysts are being developed as promising sustainable methods to obtain eco-friendly energy sources. Conducting polymers (CP) stand out among the current pool of studied photocatalysts due to their high light absorption efficiency, good stability, tunable electronic characteristics, and cost effectiveness. Various CP, such as polyaniline, polythiophene, and polypyrrole have been integrated with different semiconducting nanomaterials to produce photocatalytic composites. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the synthesis of CP and their nanocomposites for application in CO2 photoreduction and water splitting into fuel production using different polymeric composites. Many composite photocatalysts show synergistic effects between the polymeric material and other counterparts in the composite. The improvement in the inactivity of the composite can be attributed to the band configurations of the composite. Improving the separation of excitons, widening the light absorption region, enhancing the substrate adsorption, and preventing photocorrosion conductive polymers can significantly increase the photocatalytic activity under visible light. The addition of conducting polymers with an inorganic materials dramatically change their band positions and may reduce the possiblilty of electron hole recombination. Here, we explain by what means conductive polymeric material can improve the efficiency of the composite in an organized manner, thereby providing a comprehensive reference to the field. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of polymeric catalysts have been discussed briefly.Research articlePolyaniline/polyvinyl alcohol blends: Effect of sulfonic acid dopants on microstructural, optical, thermal and electrical propertiesSynthetic Metals, Volume 191, 2014, pp. 126-134Show abstractThis correspondence reports the preparation and performance of different polyaniline–polyvinyl blends (PANI–PVA) doped with sulfonated acids. PANI is prepared by in situ dispersion polymerisation, and a subsequent extensive study determines the effect of protonation upon doping with four different types of acids. We obtain the blends by changing the four different dopants, viz. β-naphtalenesulfonic acid (NSA), camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) and p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA), while maintaining constant PANI and PVA concentrations. The polymer thin films are deposited on glass substrates by the dip-cast procedure. Lastly, the films of the obtained blends are characterised by surface, structural morphology (elemental analysis, AFM, SEM, FTIR and XRD), thermal properties (TGA and DSC) and UV–vis spectroscopy. The morphological analysis shows that the nanoparticles form different shapes, which depend on the type of dopant, whereas the FTIR spectra show the chemical interaction between the two polymers. The thermal study reveals three-step degradation of the polymer blends. To confirm the possible use of these blends in the electrical industry, the electrical properties are studied by in-plane I–V characteristics and four probe conductivity measurements.Research articleIntrinsically conducting polymers in electrochemical energy technology: Trends and progressElectrochimica Acta, Volume 122, 2014, pp. 93-107Show abstractThe use of intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) like polythiophene (PTh), polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) in devices and systems for electrochemical energy storage and conversion is briefly reviewed with a focus on an overview distinguishing between already established uses and potential applications. Basic principles in these three major fields are highlighted:•ICPs as active masses.•ICPs as conductance-enhancing additives.•ICPs as auxiliary materials beyond conductance.Research articleMultifunctional electrocatalysts derived from conducting polymer and metal organic framework complexesNano Energy, Volume 45, 2018, pp. 127-135Show abstractHigh cost, scarcity, and detrimental environmental effect of the noble-metal based catalysts have prompted the seek of less expensive, more benign, and earth abundant substitutes for energy conversion and storage. Here, we demonstrate a novel multifunctional electrocatalyst constructed by pyrolysis of the complex of polyaniline (PANI) and metal organic framework [Co-based MOF; zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67)]. The resultant PANI/ZIF-67 complex unveiled excellent electrocatalytic activities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. It was found that the catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 complex towards ORR, OER and HER could be tuned by simple changing the weight ratio of PANI to the MOF. Further, we tested the material as an air electrode for a primary zinc-air battery, demonstrating an open-circuit potential of 1.42 V and a peak power density of ~ 45 mW cm−2 - both are superior to those of its counterpart of the Pt/C air-electrode. The excellent multifunctional catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 are mainly attributed to the synergistic combination of cobalt nanoparticles, Co3O4, and nitrogen doped carbon from the PANI/ZIF-67 complex after pyrolysis.Research articleProtective polymeric films for industrial substrates: A critical review on past and recent applications with conducting polymers and polymer composites/nanocompositesProgress in Materials Science, Volume 104, 2019, pp. 380-450Show abstractCorrosion defined as the deterioration of a material when it interacts with its environment is a global problem. Among the different strategies employed to combat corrosion, the use of coatings and corrosion inhibitors are the most popular. Coatings or corrosion inhibitors form a layer over the metallic substrate and protect it against corrosion. Polymers, both naturally occurring and synthetic have been tested for metal corrosion protection as replacement for the toxic inorganic and organic corrosion inhibitors. Interest in them stems from their availability, cost effectiveness, and eco-friendliness (especially for natural polymers) in addition to the inherent stability and multiple adsorption centers. However, it is found that most polymeric materials studied are moderate corrosion inhibitors. Several attempts such as copolymerization, addition of substances that exert synergistic effect, cross linking, blending, and most recently incorporation of inorganic substances in nano size into the polymer matrix have been made to improve the inhibition ability of polymers. In this review, the application of conducting polymers, polymer composites and nanocomposites for corrosion protection of different industrial metal substrates are explored based on reported experimental data and their mechanism of inhibition explained. Some identified drawbacks and future direction in this area have also been highlighted.View full textCopyright © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.\n",

These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35 nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, comparable to 530 mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90 mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications. To study the interface, thin films of a PPy/[Sn(dmit)3]2 were electrochemically grown with the aid of a microcell typically used in scanning tunneling microscopy assays. Raman and FTIR spectroscopies showed the effect of dimensionality on those materials, especially on the vibrational modes of dmit ring and on the 75 nm thick PPy/[Sn (dmit)3]2 film, which presents an optimized polymer chain conjunction length and a 20 % greater contribution to the polaron charge carriers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed the polaron/bipolaron ratio data, allowing us to determine other contributions to the surface charge density. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images show the hybrid thin film's different growth modes and the roughness evolution as a function of the electrochemical signal used in the synthesis.Acetylcholinesterase modified inkjet-printed graphene/gold nanoparticle/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) hybrid electrode for ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection2023, BioelectrochemistryShow abstractThis study successfully created a portable acetylcholinesterase sensor on a printed hybrid electrode capable of detecting chlorpyrifos in the field. While a screen-printed electrode was chosen herein to enable a single-use and portable platform for the in-field application, the hybrid material was incorporated to ensure ultrasensitive detection at lower electrode potentials. The hybrid ink of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated on graphene (GP) sheets in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was synthesized through a simple completely-green one-pot process. The subsequent characterization was carried out via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The synergy resulting from the greater surface area and enhanced transfer of electrons combined with high levels of electrocatalytic activity and superb conductivity offered by GP, AuNP, and PEDOT:PSS allows the sensor to exhibit ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection at the relatively low detection limit of 0.07 nM. The sensor demonstrated in this study also exhibits good reproducibility, desirable stability, and a successful application for the real sample with satisfactory recovery results of around 106 %, indicating its potential for use as a tool in the analysis of pesticides.Enzyme based bioelectrocatalysis over laccase immobilized poly-thiophene supported carbon fiber paper for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone2022, Molecular CatalysisShow abstractA modified electrode based on laccase immobilized poly-thiophene-3-carboxylic acid supported on carbon fiber paper was developed for the electrocatalytic oxidation of D-ribofuranose to otherwise difficult-to-access D-ribonolactone, a precursor for C-nucleoside based drug like Remdesivir. The electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuranose was achieved by the TEMPO-mediated electrochemical process. The experimental parameters were optimized and validated using Design of Experiment (DoE) statistical tool indicating the concentration of TEMPO and stirring as important parameters in bulk electrolysis. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuronose followed single electron anodic oxidation of TEMPO mediated by laccase to the corresponding oxoammonium nitrosonium species which was vital for the mediated electrochemical oxidation. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation was established using cyclic voltammetry and computational studies. The plausible interactions of laccase enzyme with TEMPO mediator were studied using molecular docking experiments. This facile method was successfully applied for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone.Electropolymerized melamine for simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine2020, Food ChemistryShow abstractPoly(melamine) (PMel) was synthesized via the electropolymerization of melamine monomer, which was then characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The possible polymerization mechanisms of melamine were also revealed by FT-IR spectroscopy and UV–Vis spectroscopy. Next, the PMel modified GCE (PMel/GCE) was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite (NO2−) and tartrazine, and the parameters were optimized. The kinetic study showed that the electrochemical oxidation of nitrite and tartrazine at the surface of PMel/GCE is a typical surface-controlled electrode process. Under the optimun conditions, the developed sensor outperformed those previously reported, and it also exhibited high selectivity and reproducibility. Finally, the PMel/GCE was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine in foodstuffs, and the results indicated that the proposed sensor could be a promising candidate for accurate determination of nitrite and tartrazine in real food samples.The role of electrolytically deposited palladium and platinum metal nanoparticles dispersed onto poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene) for enhanced glucose electrooxidation in biofuel cells2020, Electrochimica ActaShow abstractGlucose biofuel cells are one of the promising power supplies with a competent long-term stability and power density. In this respect, catalysts of palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) metal nanoparticles film coated electrode were fabricated for biofuel cell. The Pt and Pd particles were electrochemically deposited onto glassy carbon (GC) electrode modified with poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene), (p-1,8-DAN), via single or layer-by-layer electrodeposition. In results, Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC and Pd-Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC shell-core catalysts were fabricated and characterized by several analytical techniques such as AFM, EDX,SEM, TEM, and XPS, in addition to electrochemical methods. Their catalytic electrooxidation behaviors of glucose were investigated in alkaline medium. The as-prepared nano-catalysts showed improved electrocatalytic performances and better stability for glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) due to the presence of metal nanoparticles. The Pd as core and Pt as shell in Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC catalyst exhibited higher electrochemically accessible surface area (157.58 m2/g) and a favored electrooxidation efficiency. Moreover, the bimetallic Pt-Pd shell-core electrode showed higher resistance to poisoning (tolerance 1.24) and a decrease in the onset potential to -0.28 V. These multipurpose electro-catalysts are a potential candidate for developing a novel glucose biofuel cell.View all citing articles on ScopusResearch articleRecent advances in the synthesis of conducting polymers from the vapour phaseProgress in Materials Science, Volume 86, 2017, pp. 127-146Show abstractInherently conducting polymers (ICPs) combine the electrical properties of metals and semiconductors with a polymer’s ability to flex and/or stretch. In general, polymers are relatively simple to synthesise, however, ICPs themselves have had limited uptake in consumer devices. This lack of uptake is in part related to the insolubility of many ICPs in common industrial solvents, and hence methods to manufacture them in a usable form have been problematic. Vapour phase polymerisation (VPP) is one method that provides a convenient route to producing thin films of both soluble and insoluble ICPs, and nanocomposites thereof. In this critical review the VPP process will be discussed from the fundamental viewpoint of the proposed polymerisation mechanism and the parameters affecting polymer growth for a range of different monomers (thiophene, 3-hexylthiophene, pyrrole, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, etc.). Looking forward into the future, new areas of polymer design and fabrication using VPP will be discussed, such as the enhancement of ICPs through additives, and next generation device fabrication based upon VPP ICPs.Research articleConducting polymeric nanocomposites: A review in solar fuel applicationsFuel, Volume 325, 2022, Article 124899Show abstractOver the last few decades, research is being carried out in the field of photocatalysis to investigate for fuels production in sustainable manner. Due to an energy depletion and CO2 emission in the current situation urge us to produce alternative fuels. Water splitting and the reduction of carbon dioxide using various photocatalysts are being developed as promising sustainable methods to obtain eco-friendly energy sources. Conducting polymers (CP) stand out among the current pool of studied photocatalysts due to their high light absorption efficiency, good stability, tunable electronic characteristics, and cost effectiveness. Various CP, such as polyaniline, polythiophene, and polypyrrole have been integrated with different semiconducting nanomaterials to produce photocatalytic composites. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the synthesis of CP and their nanocomposites for application in CO2 photoreduction and water splitting into fuel production using different polymeric composites. Many composite photocatalysts show synergistic effects between the polymeric material and other counterparts in the composite. The improvement in the inactivity of the composite can be attributed to the band configurations of the composite. Improving the separation of excitons, widening the light absorption region, enhancing the substrate adsorption, and preventing photocorrosion conductive polymers can significantly increase the photocatalytic activity under visible light. The addition of conducting polymers with an inorganic materials dramatically change their band positions and may reduce the possiblilty of electron hole recombination. Here, we explain by what means conductive polymeric material can improve the efficiency of the composite in an organized manner, thereby providing a comprehensive reference to the field. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of polymeric catalysts have been discussed briefly.Research articlePolyaniline/polyvinyl alcohol blends: Effect of sulfonic acid dopants on microstructural, optical, thermal and electrical propertiesSynthetic Metals, Volume 191, 2014, pp. 126-134Show abstractThis correspondence reports the preparation and performance of different polyaniline–polyvinyl blends (PANI–PVA) doped with sulfonated acids. PANI is prepared by in situ dispersion polymerisation, and a subsequent extensive study determines the effect of protonation upon doping with four different types of acids. We obtain the blends by changing the four different dopants, viz. β-naphtalenesulfonic acid (NSA), camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) and p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA), while maintaining constant PANI and PVA concentrations. The polymer thin films are deposited on glass substrates by the dip-cast procedure. Lastly, the films of the obtained blends are characterised by surface, structural morphology (elemental analysis, AFM, SEM, FTIR and XRD), thermal properties (TGA and DSC) and UV–vis spectroscopy. The morphological analysis shows that the nanoparticles form different shapes, which depend on the type of dopant, whereas the FTIR spectra show the chemical interaction between the two polymers. The thermal study reveals three-step degradation of the polymer blends. To confirm the possible use of these blends in the electrical industry, the electrical properties are studied by in-plane I–V characteristics and four probe conductivity measurements.Research articleIntrinsically conducting polymers in electrochemical energy technology: Trends and progressElectrochimica Acta, Volume 122, 2014, pp. 93-107Show abstractThe use of intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) like polythiophene (PTh), polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) in devices and systems for electrochemical energy storage and conversion is briefly reviewed with a focus on an overview distinguishing between already established uses and potential applications. Basic principles in these three major fields are highlighted:•ICPs as active masses.•ICPs as conductance-enhancing additives.•ICPs as auxiliary materials beyond conductance.Research articleMultifunctional electrocatalysts derived from conducting polymer and metal organic framework complexesNano Energy, Volume 45, 2018, pp. 127-135Show abstractHigh cost, scarcity, and detrimental environmental effect of the noble-metal based catalysts have prompted the seek of less expensive, more benign, and earth abundant substitutes for energy conversion and storage. Here, we demonstrate a novel multifunctional electrocatalyst constructed by pyrolysis of the complex of polyaniline (PANI) and metal organic framework [Co-based MOF; zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67)]. The resultant PANI/ZIF-67 complex unveiled excellent electrocatalytic activities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. It was found that the catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 complex towards ORR, OER and HER could be tuned by simple changing the weight ratio of PANI to the MOF. Further, we tested the material as an air electrode for a primary zinc-air battery, demonstrating an open-circuit potential of 1.42 V and a peak power density of ~ 45 mW cm−2 - both are superior to those of its counterpart of the Pt/C air-electrode. The excellent multifunctional catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 are mainly attributed to the synergistic combination of cobalt nanoparticles, Co3O4, and nitrogen doped carbon from the PANI/ZIF-67 complex after pyrolysis.Research articleProtective polymeric films for industrial substrates: A critical review on past and recent applications with conducting polymers and polymer composites/nanocompositesProgress in Materials Science, Volume 104, 2019, pp. 380-450Show abstractCorrosion defined as the deterioration of a material when it interacts with its environment is a global problem. Among the different strategies employed to combat corrosion, the use of coatings and corrosion inhibitors are the most popular. Coatings or corrosion inhibitors form a layer over the metallic substrate and protect it against corrosion. Polymers, both naturally occurring and synthetic have been tested for metal corrosion protection as replacement for the toxic inorganic and organic corrosion inhibitors. Interest in them stems from their availability, cost effectiveness, and eco-friendliness (especially for natural polymers) in addition to the inherent stability and multiple adsorption centers. However, it is found that most polymeric materials studied are moderate corrosion inhibitors. Several attempts such as copolymerization, addition of substances that exert synergistic effect, cross linking, blending, and most recently incorporation of inorganic substances in nano size into the polymer matrix have been made to improve the inhibition ability of polymers. In this review, the application of conducting polymers, polymer composites and nanocomposites for corrosion protection of different industrial metal substrates are explored based on reported experimental data and their mechanism of inhibition explained. Some identified drawbacks and future direction in this area have also been highlighted.View full textCopyright © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved. \n",

Introduction\\nRecent estimates report that CO 2emissions in the world were more than 33 Gton in\\n2018 [ 1]. In order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, several international agreements\\nwere signed: the Conference of the Parties (COP21) held at Paris on the 12 December 2015\\nwas a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\\n2/1.5\\x0eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was conﬁrmed\\nby the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\\nnational determined contribution (NDC) was deﬁned [ 3]. However, in order to achieve this\\nobjective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\\nnot enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\\nFor this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\\nremoval (CDR) technologies, will have a crucial role in the coming years to achieve the\\nCO 2level deﬁned by the environmental agreements and stabilize the CO 2concentration\\nbetween 350 and 440 ppm [6,7].\\nNegative emissions technologies are deﬁned as the intentional human effort to remove\\nCO 2emissions from the atmosphere and include the following: afforestation and reforesta-\\ntion (AR), soil carbon sequestration (SCS), biochar (BC), bioenergy with carbon capture and\\nstorage (BECCS), direct air capture (DAC), enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization\\n(EW) and ocean fertilization (OF) [ 8]. Among these solutions, the research community has\\nbeen focused for the most part on DAC, due to its advantages [9].\\nDAC was used for decades to produce CO 2-free air to support life in submarines and\\nspacecraft systems [ 10,11]; it was presented by Lackner as a GHG mitigation technology\\nonly in 1999 [ 12]. DAC captures CO 2from the atmosphere to store it as part of a CDR\\nprocess in the long term (direct air carbon capture and storage—DACCS). Integrated\\nDAC systems have also been studied to supply climate-neutral CO 2for chemical processes\\nAppl.

DAC Technologies\\nIn this section, an overview of DAC technologies is set forth. Absorption, adsorption,\\nion exchange resin, mineral carbonation, membrane, photocatalysis, cryogenic separation,\\nelectrochemical and electrodialysis approaches are investigated.Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 8321 4 of 41\\n2.1. Absorption\\nIn absorption technology for DAC, water solutions of strong bases containing hydrox-\\nide sorbents with a strong CO 2afﬁnity, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium\\nhydroxide (KOH) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2), are used [ 3]. The absorption with\\nCa(OH) 2was proposed by Lackner et al. [ 12] and it follows the reactions described be-\\nlow [18] (see Equations (2)–(4)):\\nCa(OH)2+CO 2!CaCO 3+H2ODH25\\x0eC=\\x00109 kJ/mol (2)\\nCaCO 3!CaO +CO 2DH900\\x0eC= + 179.2 kJ/mol (3)\\nCaO +H2O!Ca(OH)2DH\\x0e\\n100\\x0eC=\\x0064.5 kJ/mol (4)\\nThe reaction starts with calcium hydroxide and CO 2to form calcium carbonate\\n(CaCO 3). The obtained calcium carbonate is precipitated, accumulated, separated from\\nwater, dried and calcined above 900\\x0eC. In this step, calcium oxide (CaO) and CO 2(con-\\ncentrated stream) are obtained. Afterwards, calcium oxide is hydrated to produce calcium\\nhydroxide. This reaction scheme allows a closed cycle. However, there are some disadvan-\\ntages to this process, such as the great amount of lost water, high temperatures and high\\nrequired energies for the calcination step (179.2 kJ/mol), and the low solubility of calcium\\nhydroxide in water, which limits the hydroxide concentration for CO 2capture [3,18].\\nThe use of NaOH water solution was proposed by Baciocchi et al. [ 37] and has a\\nsimilarity to the Kraft process used in the paper industry to extract cellulose from wood.\\nCompared to Ca(OH) 2, NaOH solution allows a strong binding of CO 2but with a higher\\nsolubility of carbonate in water. In this process, there are two cycles working simultaneously.\\nIn the ﬁrst, CO 2is captured by NaOH to produce sodium carbonate (Na 2CO 3) in the\\nabsorber through an exothermic reaction evolving at ambient temperature and pressure (see\\nEquation (5)). In the second cycle, known as the regeneration cycle, NaOH is regenerated\\nin the causticizer/precipitator: Na 2CO 3reacts with Ca(OH) 2to produce NaOH and CaCO 3\\n(see Equation (6)). From calcium carbonate, CO 2(concentrated stream) is recovered in the\\ncalciner/kiln (see Equation (7)) and receives oxygen (O 2) from an air separation unit. As\\nmentioned above, this step requires a lot of energy, with temperatures above 900\\x0eC to\\nallow the removal of water and decomposition of CaCO 3. Afterwards, CaO is hydrated to\\nCa(OH) 2in the slaker (see Equation (8)) so that it can be sent to the precipitator to be used\\nagain [18]. Figure 3 shows the scheme of this process.\\nAbsorber 2Na(OH)+CO 2!Na2CO 3+H2ODH25\\x0eC=\\x00109.4 kJ/mol (5)\\nCausticizer Na 2CO 3+Ca(OH)2!2Na(OH)+CaCO 3DH100\\x0eC=\\x005.3 kJ/mol (6)\\nCalciner CaCO 3!CaO +CO 2DH900\\x0eC= + 179.2 kJ/mol (7)\\nSlaker CaO +H2O!Ca(OH)2DH100\\x0eC=\\x0064.5 kJ/mol (8)Appl.

Zeman [41] found that the energy requirement for a packed tower \\ncontactor was 555 kWh/tonCO 2, but he suggested that the use of hollow fiber membranes \\nas packing c ould  reduce this to 361 kWh/tonCO 2 (33% lower). A detailed simulation in \\nAspen Plus of the complete process, shown in Figure 4, was carried out by Keith et al. [34] \\nfor the first time. U sing a KOH so lution, the authors found that to deliver CO 2 at 15 Mpa, \\n1458 kWh/tonCO 2 of natural gas would be required,  in addition to 366 kWh/tonCO 2 of \\nelectric energy. A large -scale plant captures about 1 MtonCO 2/year and the levelized cost \\nranges between 94 and 232 $/tonCO 2.  \\n \\nFigure 4 . Scheme of the process analyzed by Keith et al.

[ 51], comparing\\ndifferent packings, found that the optimized cost ranged from 518 $/tCO 2for M-CC to\\n568 $/tCO 2for M-250Y, making it a non-competitive mitigation system. A lower cost was\\nfound by Stolaroff [ 52] in studying a complete plant with a contactor using a spray for\\nNaOH solution: the cost range was between 80 $/tonCO 2and 250 $/tonCO 2. In the work\\nof Fasihi et al. [ 49], the expected cost for this kind of technology was reported for the 2040\\nand 2050. In the ﬁrst case, costs were in a range between 70 \\xa0/tonCO 2and 90 \\xa0/tonCO 2,\\nwhile, in the second case, costs decreased and were in a range between 55 \\xa0/tonCO 2and\\n70\\xa0/tonCO 2.\\nSome experimental works have also been presented. Holmes et al. [ 53] built an\\nabsorber prototype for the Carbon Engineering company to test the cross ﬂow and PVC\\npacking, to evaluate energy requirements and fouling by atmospheric particulates and to\\nassess technical and safety risks.\\n2.2. Adsorption\\nWhile the absorption process mainly uses an aqueous solution of NaOH, KOH or\\nCa(OH) 2, the adsorption process is based on the chemical or physical adsorption of CO 2\\nwith particular sorbents, such as amine-functionalized sorbents, metal organic frameworks\\n(MOFs), zeolites, etc. [6]. Among chemisorbents, amine-functionalized sorbents and solid\\nalkali carbonates sorbents (bulk and supported) have been proposed, while, among ph-\\nysisorbents, MOFs, zeolites and new materials, such as boron nitride nanosheets and\\nnanotubes, have been investigated [ 18]. Amine-functionalized sorbents have received sig-\\nniﬁcant attention for DAC systems due to their stability under humidity, low regeneration\\ntemperatures (50–120\\x0eC) and ﬂexibility in the choice of low-cost support [39].\\nGenerally, in the adsorption system, a single equipment unit is used, where adsorption\\nand desorption happen alternately after variations in temperature or pressure or a combi-\\nnation of the two. Generally, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is not practicable in a real\\nprocess because a pressure lower than 0.4 mbar is required. At lab scale, the temperature\\nswing adsorption (TSA) is generally used, but the use of an inert gas purge results in\\na dilute output stream. On the other hand, temperature and vacuum swing adsorption\\n(TVSA) could be used to produce a high-CO 2purity stream.\\nMost studies reported in the literature on the adsorption process are on the investigation\\nof sorbents, evaluating adsorption capacities and performances, as discussed below.\\n2.2.1. Physisorbents\\nPhysisorption occurs between the sorbent surface and CO 2, allowing only a physical\\ninteraction. Generally, materials with porosity or nanometric dimensions, such as zeolites,\\nactivated carbon, MOFs and new materials, have been considered [ 54]. Activated carbons\\nare characterized by low cost and high thermal stability, showing an adsorption capacity\\nand selectivity lower than that of zeolites at a low CO 2partial pressure but higher at a high\\nCO 2partial pressure [ 55,56]. For this reason, activated carbons are not a good choice for\\ndirect air capture [6].\\nFactors inﬂuencing the CO 2capture of zeolites are size, charge density and distribution\\nof cations in the porous structure [ 57]. Humidity has a negative effect on CO 2capture, and\\nfor this reason zeolites are not suggested for direct air capture [6].\\nMOFs are characterized by ﬂexibility in shape, pore structure, pore size and surface\\nproperties [ 58]. Similar to activated carbons, adsorption capacity and selectivity are lower\\nat low CO 2partial pressures and in the presence of humidity; MOFs are suitable for CO 2\\nstorage and not for CO 2separation. However, in recent years, attention has been directed\\nto MOFs (particularly MIL-101(Cr)) functionalized with amine (adsorption of amines onto\\nmetal sites or physical impregnation with liquid amines) which provide better performances\\nfor CO 2capture from the air due to their durability under moist conditions [ 39]. Currently,\\nthe high cost of MOFs makes their use in DAC prohibitive [6].Appl.

In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\\nTerms & Conditions\\nMost electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.

Existing carbon-capture technologies (such as the amine \\nscrubbing and Ca(OH)2/CaCO3/CaO+CO2 cycling process) typically \\nrely on an energy-intensive and centralized thermal cycling process, \\nin which elevated temperatures (as high as 900\\u2009°C in the case of CaCO3 \\ndecomposition) are needed to release the absorbed CO2 (refs.\\u200910 –12). \\nOther carbon-capture methods that use solid sorbents with high \\nporosity and surface area, such as metal–organic frameworks, have \\nshown promising capture capacities but inferior cycling stability, \\nespecially when exposed to humidity13– 15. Although electrochemical \\ncarbon-capture methods have gained attention as appealing alterna -\\ntives owing to their high energy efficiency, decentralized operation, \\nambient reaction conditions and ability to use renewable electricity, \\nsubstantial challenges must be addressed before they can be widely \\nimplemented3–5,16–18.\\nIn general, electrochemical carbon capture relies on either \\nredox-active carriers or pH swing to absorb and release CO2. The \\nredox-active carriers, such as quinones, have high energy efficiency \\nowing to their facile reaction kinetics involved in binding and releasing \\nCO2 molecules under reduced and oxidized states19,20. However, their \\npractical applications are still limited by low capture rates (typically \\n<10\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2) and sensitivity to O2 gas present in most CO2 sources. On \\nthe other hand, pH-swing methods using salt or water electrolysis to separate alkaline and acidic solutions, for CO2 absorption followed by \\nacidification to release CO2, have been reported to be insensitive to O2 \\nand can deliver larger currents (about 100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2)2,18 ,21,22. However, \\nthe decoupling of the electrolysis process from the CO2 absorption \\nprocess requires energy-intensive downstream gas–liquid contacting \\nprocesses, especially under low CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, \\nby-products such as H2 (from water splitting)23 or Cl2 (from NaCl elec-\\ntrolysis)24,25 generated in different pH-swing designs add complexity \\nand challenges to decentralized carbon capture.\\nHere we report a different carbon-capture design by coupling O2/\\nH2O electrolysis with our porous solid-electrolyte (PSE) reactor7 for a \\ncontinuous and modular CO2 capture from a wide range of CO2 sources \\nat industrially relevant capture rate, high energy efficiency, no O2 sen -\\nsitivity and easy scalability and adaptability.

By performing this OER/\\nORR redox electrolysis, the system does not consume or produce any \\nchemicals, as the generated O2 from the anode can be recycled back \\nto the cathode for a stoichiometric balance. To avoid flooding, an \\nanion-exchange membrane (AEM) and a cation-exchange membrane \\n(CEM) are inserted between the electrodes and the PSE layer. When \\nO2 molecules get reduced by an active ORR catalyst (such as commer-\\ncial Pt/C) on the cathode, large numbers of hydroxide ions (OH−) are https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06060-1\\nReceived: 1 May 2022\\nAccepted: 6 April 2023\\nPublished online: 28 June 2023\\n Check for updates\\n1Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA. 2Department of Materials Science and NanoEngineering, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA. \\n3Canadian Light Source Inc., University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. 4Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, \\nUSA. 5Department of Chemistry, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA. 6These authors contributed equally: Peng Zhu, Zhen-Yu Wu. ✉e-mail: htwang@rice.edu960  | Nature | Vol 618 | 29 June 2023\\nArticlegenerated at the catalyst–membrane interface, which react rapidly \\nwith the CO2 molecules in the stream to form carbonate or bicarbonate \\nions (Fig.\\xa0 1b). These carbonate ions, driven by the electric field, then \\nmigrate across the AEM into the PSE layer. Meanwhile, water on the \\nanode side is oxidized to generate the same amount of O2 that gets \\nconsumed and releases protons (H+) that travel across the CEM into \\nthe middle layer to compensate the charge. These crossover carbonate \\nand proton ions are recombined to form CO2 gas again, which can be \\ncontinuously pushed out and collected in its high-purity form through \\na recycling water flow through the PSE layer (Fig.\\xa0 1c).\\nOur solid-electrolyte carbon-capture design presents several advan -\\ntages over reported electrochemical carbon-capture methods. First, \\nunlike some redox-active carriers that can be poisoned by the coexist -\\ning O2 gas6, our proposed system fully uses O2 through ORR to create \\na strong interfacial alkaline environment for effective CO2 capture26. \\nSecond, there are no specific chemical inputs (other than water) or \\nconsumption during the capture process, as the device performs ORR/\\nOER redox electrolysis. Third, the triple-phase boundary created at \\nthe cathode of our solid-electrolyte reactor allows for rapid diffu -\\nsion of CO2 in the gas phase towards the catalyst–membrane inter -\\nface26–28, enabling the reactor to operate under large current densities \\nfor fast CO2 capture while still maintaining high Faradaic efficiencies. \\nThis is different from the traditional pH-swing method, in which the \\nliquid-phase mass diffusion limits the rates of CO2 adsorption (through \\ngas–liquid contact). Fourth, the capture system can take advantage \\nof past advancements in fuel cells and water-splitting catalysts for \\nhigh energy efficiencies and easy scalability. Finally, our PSE device \\nenables a continuous, simultaneous and integrated carbon-capture \\nand release process, which differs from traditional absorption/desorp -\\ntion cycles and simplifies the carbon-capture system for many on-site \\napplications (Fig.\\xa0 1d).Concept verification\\nTo validate the proposed CO2-capture mechanism, we used commercial \\nPt/C and IrO2 as the electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, respectively29. \\nDifferent CO2:O2 ratios were used to establish a fundamental under -\\nstanding of the intrinsic CO2-separation performance of the system \\n(Methods and Supplementary Figs.\\xa02 and 3). As shown in Fig.\\xa02a, the \\nORR/OER I–V curves under different CO2 concentrations were similar, \\nsuggesting that the O2 concentration instead of the CO2 concentration \\ndetermines the cell activity. The onset potential (under 0.5\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2) \\nis around 0.8\\u2009V, including OER and ORR overpotentials (around 200–\\n300\\u2009mV each), ohmic drops and pH overpotentials during electrolysis3. \\nUnder high current density, at which O2 mass diffusion starts to affect \\nORR activity, the I –V curve (without iR compensations; Supplementary \\nFig.\\xa04) of 4.6%\\u2009CO2 showed slightly better cell voltage than that of 8.6% \\nor 13.9% owing to its higher O2 partial pressure.\\nUnder a constant ORR/OER electrolysis current, we can obtain the \\nCO2-capture rate, which is equivalent to the CO2 crossover rate, by meas -\\nuring the CO2 flow rate out of the PSE layer using water-displacement \\nand titration methods for both the gas-phase and dissolved CO2 \\n(Methods and Supplementary Figs.\\xa05–7). This CO2 dissolution can be \\navoided in practical operations by continuously recycling the deion -\\nized water stream. The CO2 bubble formation within the PSE layer \\nwas found to have little impact on the middle-layer pressure or the \\ndevice operational stability (Supplementary Fig.\\xa08). Furthermore, the \\nrecovered gas product was confirmed to be high-purity CO2 through \\ngas chromatography analysis (up to 99.7% without considering water \\nvapour; Supplementary Fig.\\xa09), allowing for direct integration with \\ndownstream utilization or storage processes without the typical \\nenergy-intensive secondary purification processes.

As shown in Fig.\\xa02b , with 13.9%\\u2009CO2 \\nconcentration, the CO2-capture rate increased almost linearly with the \\nORR current density ranging from 10 to 500\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2. By estimating the \\nslope of the CO2-capture (or crossover) rate as a function of the ORR \\ncurrent, we found that, for every two-electron transfer during which \\ntwo OH− ions were generated, there was one CO2 molecule captured, \\nsuggesting that the CO2 crossover is mainly through the carbonate ion \\ninstead of bicarbonate because of the high local interfacial pH. This \\nconclusion is supported by the well-matched CO2-capture rates with \\nthe theoretical guideline, which assumes 100% carbonate crossover \\nand is consistent with observations reported in previous studies5,16,18,30. \\nTherefore, here we defined the carbonate Faradaic efficiency (FEcarbon -\\nate) to better evaluate the carbon-capture efficiencies under different \\nreaction conditions (Methods). The FEcarbonate  was maintained over 90% \\nacross a wide range of cell currents under 13.9%\\u2009CO2, suggesting a high \\nutilization efficiency of generated OH− ions. However, at high current densities, FEcarbonate  showed a slight decrease owing to the competition \\nbetween the rate of carbonate formation and OH− migration. There \\nwere sufficient CO2 molecules around the catalyst–membrane interface \\nat low current densities to react rapidly with the generated OH− ions \\nbefore they were transported across the membrane by means of car -\\nbonate ions form. For high ORR currents, a large number of OH− ions  \\nwere generated, depleting the surrounding CO2 molecules at a fast rate. \\nThis limits the mass diffusion of CO2 and allows some OH− ions to move \\ndirectly across the AEM without reacting with CO2 molecules, resulting \\nin lowered FEs. Even with lower FEcarbonate , our solid-electrolyte reactor \\ndelivered an impressive carbon-capture rate of 3.34\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2 (or \\n0.137\\u2009mmolCO2\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2) at 500\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, which is equivalent to a rate \\nof about 86.7\\u2009kg\\u2009CO2\\u2009day−1\\u2009m−2. According to the reaction mechanism \\ndiscussed above, we can anticipate that the maximal current density \\nrequired to maintain high FEs would decrease with decreasing CO2 \\nconcentrations in the input gas owing to limited mass diffusion.

Please note that \\nthe choice of ion conduction in the solid electrolyte plays a critical role \\nin determining the cell voltage, particularly under high current density  \\n(Supplementary Fig.\\xa011).\\nIn principle, because ORR catalysis and CO2 capture are independent \\nprocesses, the O2 partial pressure should only affect the cell activity and \\nnot its carbon-capture rates or FEs3,4. As shown by the I–V curve com-\\nparison in Fig.\\xa0 2e, the solid-electrolyte reactor with air\\u2009+\\u200913.9%\\u2009CO2 pre -\\nsented similar ORR/OER electrolysis activities to that of O2\\u2009+\\u200913.9%\\u2009CO2 \\nat low currents, but required higher voltages at higher currents owing \\nto its lower O2 partial pressure. However, this cell-voltage difference \\ndid not affect the current efficiencies or CO2-capture rates (Fig.\\xa0 2f and \\nSupplementary Figs.\\xa012 and 13). To further test the carbon-capture \\ncapability and adaptability of our solid-electrolyte device, we lowered \\nthe feed CO2 levels to 6,200 and 2,950\\u2009ppm while evaluating the cell \\nperformance (Supplementary Fig.\\xa014). At low CO2 concentrations, the \\nmain limitation to the carbon-capture rate is the mass transport of \\nCO2 from the inlet flow to the catalyst–membrane interface, which is \\na common challenge for scaling up of all carbon-capture methods. As \\nshown in Fig.\\xa0 2g, the CO2-capture efficiency was maintained above 80% \\nwithin the current range 1–10\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 but rapidly decreased to around \\n50–60% when reaching 20–30\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2. This FE decrease is because of \\nthe mass-transfer limit of CO2 gas under this low-concentration condi -\\ntion, which became more prominent when the input CO2 concentration \\nwas further reduced to 2,950\\u2009ppm (Fig.\\xa0 2h). In this case, the FEcarbonate  \\ndecreased to about 55% under 10\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 current compared with 90% \\nin the case of 6,200\\u2009ppm. The observed FE trends imply that the opera -\\ntional current of the carbon-capture cell can be adjusted to suit different \\napplication scenarios, depending on the input CO2 concentrations, \\nwhile still maintaining high electron efficiencies.\\nIn practical scenarios, CO impurities are widely present in industrial \\nflue gas owing to incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, which \\ncould greatly affect the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst because \\nof poisoning effects31,32. As shown in Fig.\\xa0 2i, the cell voltage under a \\nfixed current of 100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 showed an immediate increase when a CO \\nstream was mixed with the cathode gas input and continuously rose by \\nabout 300\\u2009mV within 10\\u2009h operation, suggesting a fast degradation of \\nPt/C ORR activity. The impurity poisoning effects on the Pt catalyst, as \\nwell as Pt scarcity and high cost, could limit the practical application \\nof our solid-electrolyte carbon-capture device.\\nThe impacts of different ORR catalysts\\nOne unique advantage of our carbon-capture device is the flexibility \\nin using different ORR and OER catalysts. Replacing the expensive \\nPt/C noble-metal catalyst with earth-abundant ORR catalysts can sub -\\nstantially reduce the materials cost; alternative ORR catalysts with \\ndifferent material properties could help mitigate the CO poisoning \\neffect observed on Pt/C. One promising candidate is the recently devel-\\noped transition-metal single-atom catalyst (SAC), such as Fe or Co \\nsingle-atomic sites coordinated in N-doped carbon33,34. These SACs \\npresented similar ORR performance to commercial Pt/C with high \\nresistance to CO poisoning owing to the weak interaction between CO \\nand the transition-metal centre35. Here we used Co-SAC as a representa -\\ntive ORR catalyst to investigate these possible advantages compared \\nwith Pt/C. Our Co-SAC was synthesized on the basis of a hard-template \\nmethod developed in our previous study, which guarantees high poros -\\nity and uniform distribution of metal single-atomic sites on the carbon \\nmatrix36 (Methods). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and \\nother characterization tools suggest an interconnected 3D porous \\nstructure of Co-SAC reversely templating from the SiO2 nanoparticle \\ntemplates (Fig.\\xa03a and Supplementary Figs.\\xa015–18). X-ray absorption \\nspectroscopy (XAS) confirmed the atomic dispersion of Co as shown in Fig.\\xa03b,c, in which only the Co–N coordination (located at around \\n1.4\\u2009Å) was observed in the spectrum and no Co–Co interactions (about \\n2.15\\u2009Å)37.\\nWe first evaluated the carbon-capture performance of our Co-SAC \\nunder a standard 13.9%\\u2009CO2 concentration. The I –V curve showed a \\nsimilar catalytic activity and FEcarbonate  compared with Pt/C catalyst \\n(Fig.\\xa03d and Supplementary Figs.\\xa019–21), suggesting the feasibility of \\nreplacing Pt/C noble-metal catalyst with earth-abundant materials. \\nDifferences became evident when we tuned the CO2 concentration \\nto 6,200\\u2009ppm, at which mass transport plays a more critical role in \\ndetermining carbon-capture performance. As shown in Fig.\\xa0 3e, the \\nCo-SAC maintained a high FE of more than 80% until 20\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, \\nunder which the Pt/C counterpart only achieved roughly 60% FE. \\nThe carbon-capture rate of Co-SAC was 0.12\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2 under \\n20\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, suggesting a more than 30% improvement compared with \\nPt/C (about 0.09\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2). The improvement ratio was further \\nenhanced to around 50% under 30\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2. Our Co-SAC can deliver \\n40\\u2009mA\\u2009m−2 current density with 60% FE and a carbon-capture rate of \\n0.18\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2 or 4.8\\u2009kgCO2\\u2009day−1\\u2009m−2, suggesting a highly efficient \\ncarbon capture considering this low-CO2-concentration source. Differ -\\nent from Pt/C catalyst with the active sites densely packed on the surface \\nof Pt nanoparticles, Co-SAC has uniformly dispersed active sites across \\nthe whole carbon matrix, which enables a more uniform generation of \\nOH− ions for a more efficient CO2 capture, especially when the CO2 mass \\ndiffusion is limited (Supplementary Fig.\\xa022). We further explored our \\nCo-SAC and PSE device carbon-capture limit by testing its direct air \\ncapture (DAC) performance (400\\u2009ppm CO2; Methods). As expected, the \\nORR current density to maintain high FEcarbonate  was decreased because \\nof the limited carbon mass diffusions under DAC conditions (Supple-\\nmentary Fig.\\xa023). Our reactor delivered almost 100% FEcarbonate  under \\na 0.5\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 ORR current. This represents a carbon-capture rate of \\n1.14\\u2009mg\\u2009m−2\\u2009s−1, comparable with the state-of-the-art DAC demonstra-\\ntion of about 1\\u2009mg\\u2009m−2\\u2009s−1(ref.\\u200938). Future improvements, including \\nlower-cost catalysts, electrodes and ion-exchange membranes, are \\nneeded to justify the scalability of our PSE reactor for DAC application \\nwhen compared with decoupled electrochemical/chemical reactions, \\nin which electrolysis could be operated under high current densities. \\nOur mass-transport simulation model and further DAC experiments \\non the impacts of pressure and catalyst-layer thickness lay the ground -\\nwork for different tuning knobs to enhance the device performance in \\nthe future (Supplementary Discussion\\xa01, Supplementary Table\\xa01 and \\nSupplementary Figs.\\xa024 and 25).\\nThe CO injection experiment shown in Fig.\\xa0 3f suggests the high \\nresistance of our Co-SAC to CO poisoning resulting from the weak \\ninteractions between the metal single-atomic sites and CO molecules32. \\nNo notable changes were observed in the cell voltage and FEs (>90%) when CO or other toxic gas (such as NO and SO\\n2) was injected into the \\ninput gas stream (Supplementary Fig.\\xa026). The potential for practical \\ncarbon-capture application was further demonstrated by the high \\nstability of Co-SAC in our solid-electrolyte device (Fig.\\xa03g and Sup -\\nplementary Figs.\\xa027 and 28), in which the cell voltage and FE remained \\nunchanged during the 72-h continuous carbon-capture operation \\nunder a fixed current density of 100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2.\\nTo make our study more practical, instead of using the above CO2–O2  \\nor CO2–air mixtures, we prepared simulated flue gas (13.9%\\u2009CO2, 7.8%\\u2009O2, \\n76.3%\\u2009N2 and 2.0%\\u2009H2O) as the gas input to our solid-electrolyte device. \\nA tandem reactor system, with two identical solid-electrolyte cells but \\noperated under two-stage current densities, was designed to deliver \\nboth high carbon-removal efficiencies and high FEs (Fig.\\xa0 3h).

We would like to emphasize \\nthat the PSE is an indispensable part of our carbon-capture device even \\nwith an ultrathin middle layer (Supplementary Fig.\\xa032).\\nSecond, the carbon-crossover efficiencies can be improved by means \\nof the formation of different types of anion. As discussed above, we \\nbelieve that the carbon crossover is through the carbonate ions, which \\nrequire two-electron transfer per captured CO2 molecule (0.5\\u2009CO2 per e−).  \\nOne possible alternative to improving the electron efficiency is estab -\\nlishing the CO2–H2O2 equilibrium42. Similar to the CO2–OH− reaction in \\nthe water system, CO2 can readily react with the HO2− anion from H2O2 \\nto form percarbonate (HCO4−)42. If we replace the 4e−-ORR catalyst in \\nour solid-electrolyte reactor with a 2e−-ORR catalyst7, we may obtain a \\nmaximal 50% increase in electron efficiencies. With every two-electron \\ntransfer, one OH− and one HO2− could form, which can transport 1.5\\u2009CO2 \\ngas molecules across the AEM (0.75\\u2009CO2 per e−; Fig.\\xa0 4d). To validate this \\nhypothesis, we used the Ni-SAC with a reasonable H2O2 selectivity in our \\nsolid-electrolyte reactor for carbon-capture tests (Fig.\\xa0 4e and Supple -\\nmentary Figs.\\xa033–36). As shown in Fig.\\xa0 4f, the carbon-capture rates on \\nNi-SAC suggested a notable increase compared with 4e−-ORR catalysts \\ndemonstrated above. Under 100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 current density, the 4e−-ORR \\ncatalyst presented a carbon-capture rate of around 0.7\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2, \\nwhereas the Ni-SAC delivered a rate of 1.05\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2. The increased \\ncarbon-capture rates were carefully confirmed by excluding the pos-\\nsibility of O2 gas bubbles from H2O2 self-decomposition in the PSE \\nlayer or any impacts of H2O2 on titrations (Supplementary Discus -\\nsion\\xa02 and Supplementary Figs.\\xa037 and 38). By calculating the number \\nof CO2 molecules captured per electron transferred, instead of using \\nthe above-defined FEcarbonate  resulting from the multianion crossover \\nmechanism involved, a promising 0.71\\u2009CO2 per e− was achieved under \\n100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, compared with 0.47\\u2009CO2 per e− in the case of 4e−-ORR \\n(Fig.\\xa0 4f). Using other 2e−-ORR catalysts, including oxidized carbon \\nblack (OCB) and Fe-SAC (Supplementary Figs.\\xa039 and 40), we showed \\nthat the carbon-capture electron efficiency linearly scales with H2O2 \\nselectivity under the same current density, further demonstrating the \\nimprovement of HO2− ions in transporting CO2 molecules (Fig.\\xa0 4g). We \\ncan also exclude the possibility of bicarbonate crossover in the case of \\nH2O2, which could also improve the electron efficiencies (Supplemen -\\ntary Discussion\\xa03).\\nThe improvements in cell voltages and electron efficiencies dis -\\ncussed above can further reduce the carbon-capture cost of our device.  \\nA techno-economic analysis based on previously reported models and \\nthe performance of our device (Figs.\\xa02  and 3 ) suggests a base cost of \\nabout $83 per ton of captured CO2 (refs.\\u200943 ,44) (Fig.\\xa0 4h, Supplemen -\\ntary Fig.\\xa041, Supplementary Discussion\\xa04 and Supplementary Table\\xa02).  \\nBy taking into consideration the demonstrated improvements, \\nincluding a thinner PSE layer (Fig.\\xa0 4b) and higher electron efficien -\\ncies (Fig.\\xa04f ), the estimated cost can be reduced to about $58 per ton \\nand can be more attractive if the value of generated H2O2 was included. \\nConsidering this very initial study with each component to be further \\nimproved and optimized in future research, our solid-electrolyte \\ncarbon-capture reactor represents a competitive, promising and sus-\\ntainable strategy for carbon management. For example, we can switch \\nto other facile redox couples in different application scenarios, such \\nas hydrogen evolution reaction/hydrogen oxidation reaction (HER/\\nHOR) or organic and inorganic molecular redox couples, to further \\nreduce the overpotentials. Further improvements of the ohmic drops \\nof the reactor can be expected with a thinner middle layer and more \\nconductive solid-electrolyte particles. Other operation parameters, \\nsuch as temperature for better reaction kinetics and pressure for bet-\\nter mass transport, could also be implemented for different appli -\\ncation scenarios (Supplementary Figs.\\xa042 and 43). The mentioned \\nimprovements could bring the carbon-capture cost down to about  \\n$33 per ton.Conclusion\\nGiven various electrochemical redox reactions available with proton–\\nelectron coupling processes (HER/HOR, quinone redox couples, flow \\nbattery redox couples and so on), our solid-electrolyte reactor sets \\nup a versatile carbon-capture platform that could be implemented \\nin many practical scenarios in the future. It is worth noting that many \\nelectrochemical redox couples, such as HER/HOR, present much better \\nreaction kinetics and lower overpotentials than the OER/ORR cou -\\nple we demonstrated in this work, which can substantially reduce the \\ncell-operation voltage and improve the carbon-capture efficiencies. \\nVarious cell and operation parameters, such as the thickness of the \\nsolid-electrolyte layer, operation temperature and pressure, redox cou -\\nple catalyst improvements and reaction pathway tuning, can be further \\noptimized as future research directions to improve the carbon-capture \\nenergy efficiencies and costs for practical deployments.\\nOnline content\\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summa -\\nries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowl -\\nedgements, peer review information; details of author contributions \\nand competing interests; and statements of data and code availability \\nare available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06060-1.\\n1.

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone–hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35\\xa0nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520\\xa0mV at a current density of 10\\xa0mA\\xa0cm−2, comparable to 530\\xa0mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90\\xa0mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications. To study the interface, thin films of a PPy/[Sn(dmit)3]2 were electrochemically grown with the aid of a microcell typically used in scanning tunneling microscopy assays. Raman and FTIR spectroscopies showed the effect of dimensionality on those materials, especially on the vibrational modes of dmit ring and on the 75\\xa0nm thick PPy/[Sn (dmit)3]2 film, which presents an optimized polymer chain conjunction length and a 20\\xa0% greater contribution to the polaron charge carriers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed the polaron/bipolaron ratio data, allowing us to determine other contributions to the surface charge density. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images show the hybrid thin film's different growth modes and the roughness evolution as a function of the electrochemical signal used in the synthesis.Acetylcholinesterase modified inkjet-printed graphene/gold nanoparticle/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) hybrid electrode for ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection2023, BioelectrochemistryShow abstractThis study successfully created a portable acetylcholinesterase sensor on a printed hybrid electrode capable of detecting chlorpyrifos in the field. While a screen-printed electrode was chosen herein to enable a single-use and portable platform for the in-field application, the hybrid material was incorporated to ensure ultrasensitive detection at lower electrode potentials. The hybrid ink of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated on graphene (GP) sheets in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was synthesized through a simple completely-green one-pot process. The subsequent characterization was carried out via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The synergy resulting from the greater surface area and enhanced transfer of electrons combined with high levels of electrocatalytic activity and superb conductivity offered by GP, AuNP, and PEDOT:PSS allows the sensor to exhibit ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection at the relatively low detection limit of 0.07\\xa0nM. The sensor demonstrated in this study also exhibits good reproducibility, desirable stability, and a successful application for the real sample with satisfactory recovery results of around 106\\xa0%, indicating its potential for use as a tool in the analysis of pesticides.Enzyme based bioelectrocatalysis over laccase immobilized poly-thiophene supported carbon fiber paper for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone2022, Molecular CatalysisShow abstractA modified electrode based on laccase immobilized poly-thiophene-3-carboxylic acid supported on carbon fiber paper was developed for the electrocatalytic oxidation of D-ribofuranose to otherwise difficult-to-access D-ribonolactone, a precursor for C-nucleoside based drug like Remdesivir. The electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuranose was achieved by the TEMPO-mediated electrochemical process. The experimental parameters were optimized and validated using Design of Experiment (DoE) statistical tool indicating the concentration of TEMPO and stirring as important parameters in bulk electrolysis. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuronose followed single electron anodic oxidation of TEMPO mediated by laccase to the corresponding oxoammonium nitrosonium species which was vital for the mediated electrochemical oxidation. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation was established using cyclic voltammetry and computational studies. The plausible interactions of laccase enzyme with TEMPO mediator were studied using molecular docking experiments. This facile method was successfully applied for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone.Electropolymerized melamine for simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine2020, Food ChemistryShow abstractPoly(melamine) (PMel) was synthesized via the electropolymerization of melamine monomer, which was then characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The possible polymerization mechanisms of melamine were also revealed by FT-IR spectroscopy and UV–Vis spectroscopy. Next, the PMel modified GCE (PMel/GCE) was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite (NO2−) and tartrazine, and the parameters were optimized. The kinetic study showed that the electrochemical oxidation of nitrite and tartrazine at the surface of PMel/GCE is a typical surface-controlled electrode process. Under the optimun conditions, the developed sensor outperformed those previously reported, and it also exhibited high selectivity and reproducibility. Finally, the PMel/GCE was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine in foodstuffs, and the results indicated that the proposed sensor could be a promising candidate for accurate determination of nitrite and tartrazine in real food samples.The role of electrolytically deposited palladium and platinum metal nanoparticles dispersed onto poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene) for enhanced glucose electrooxidation in biofuel cells2020, Electrochimica ActaShow abstractGlucose biofuel cells are one of the promising power supplies with a competent long-term stability and power density. In this respect, catalysts of palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) metal nanoparticles film coated electrode were fabricated for biofuel cell. The Pt and Pd particles were electrochemically deposited onto glassy carbon (GC) electrode modified with poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene), (p-1,8-DAN), via single or layer-by-layer electrodeposition. In results, Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC and Pd-Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC shell-core catalysts were fabricated and characterized by several analytical techniques such as AFM, EDX,SEM, TEM, and XPS, in addition to electrochemical methods. Their catalytic electrooxidation behaviors of glucose were investigated in alkaline medium. The as-prepared nano-catalysts showed improved electrocatalytic performances and better stability for glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) due to the presence of metal nanoparticles. The Pd as core and Pt as shell in Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC catalyst exhibited higher electrochemically accessible surface area (157.58 m2/g) and a favored electrooxidation efficiency. Moreover, the bimetallic Pt-Pd shell-core electrode showed higher resistance to poisoning (tolerance 1.24) and a decrease in the onset potential to -0.28\\xa0V. These multipurpose electro-catalysts are a potential candidate for developing a novel glucose biofuel cell.View all citing articles on ScopusResearch articleRecent advances in the synthesis of conducting polymers from the vapour phaseProgress in Materials Science, Volume 86, 2017, pp. 127-146Show abstractInherently conducting polymers (ICPs) combine the electrical properties of metals and semiconductors with a polymer’s ability to flex and/or stretch. In general, polymers are relatively simple to synthesise, however, ICPs themselves have had limited uptake in consumer devices. This lack of uptake is in part related to the insolubility of many ICPs in common industrial solvents, and hence methods to manufacture them in a usable form have been problematic. Vapour phase polymerisation (VPP) is one method that provides a convenient route to producing thin films of both soluble and insoluble ICPs, and nanocomposites thereof. In this critical review the VPP process will be discussed from the fundamental viewpoint of the proposed polymerisation mechanism and the parameters affecting polymer growth for a range of different monomers (thiophene, 3-hexylthiophene, pyrrole, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, etc.). Looking forward into the future, new areas of polymer design and fabrication using VPP will be discussed, such as the enhancement of ICPs through additives, and next generation device fabrication based upon VPP ICPs.Research articleConducting polymeric nanocomposites: A review in solar fuel applicationsFuel, Volume 325, 2022, Article 124899Show abstractOver the last few decades, research is being carried out in the field of photocatalysis to investigate for fuels production in sustainable manner. Due to an energy depletion and CO2 emission in the current situation urge us to produce alternative fuels. Water splitting and the reduction of carbon dioxide using various photocatalysts are being developed as promising sustainable methods to obtain eco-friendly energy sources. Conducting polymers (CP) stand out among the current pool of studied photocatalysts due to their high light absorption efficiency, good stability, tunable electronic characteristics, and cost effectiveness. Various CP, such as polyaniline, polythiophene, and polypyrrole have been integrated with different semiconducting nanomaterials to produce photocatalytic composites. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the synthesis of CP and their nanocomposites for application in CO2 photoreduction and water splitting into fuel production using different polymeric composites. Many composite photocatalysts show synergistic effects between the polymeric material and other counterparts in the composite. The improvement in the inactivity of the composite can be attributed to the band configurations of the composite. Improving the separation of excitons, widening the light absorption region, enhancing the substrate adsorption, and preventing photocorrosion conductive polymers can significantly increase the photocatalytic activity under visible light. The addition of conducting polymers with an inorganic materials dramatically change their band positions and may reduce the possiblilty of electron hole recombination. Here, we explain by what means conductive polymeric material can improve the efficiency of the composite in an organized manner, thereby providing a comprehensive reference to the field. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of polymeric catalysts have been discussed briefly.Research articlePolyaniline/polyvinyl alcohol blends: Effect of sulfonic acid dopants on microstructural, optical, thermal and electrical propertiesSynthetic Metals, Volume 191, 2014, pp. 126-134Show abstractThis correspondence reports the preparation and performance of different polyaniline–polyvinyl blends (PANI–PVA) doped with sulfonated acids. PANI is prepared by in situ dispersion polymerisation, and a subsequent extensive study determines the effect of protonation upon doping with four different types of acids. We obtain the blends by changing the four different dopants, viz. β-naphtalenesulfonic acid (NSA), camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) and p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA), while maintaining constant PANI and PVA concentrations. The polymer thin films are deposited on glass substrates by the dip-cast procedure. Lastly, the films of the obtained blends are characterised by surface, structural morphology (elemental analysis, AFM, SEM, FTIR and XRD), thermal properties (TGA and DSC) and UV–vis spectroscopy. The morphological analysis shows that the nanoparticles form different shapes, which depend on the type of dopant, whereas the FTIR spectra show the chemical interaction between the two polymers. The thermal study reveals three-step degradation of the polymer blends. To confirm the possible use of these blends in the electrical industry, the electrical properties are studied by in-plane I–V characteristics and four probe conductivity measurements.Research articleIntrinsically conducting polymers in electrochemical energy technology: Trends and progressElectrochimica Acta, Volume 122, 2014, pp. 93-107Show abstractThe use of intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) like polythiophene (PTh), polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) in devices and systems for electrochemical energy storage and conversion is briefly reviewed with a focus on an overview distinguishing between already established uses and potential applications. Basic principles in these three major fields are highlighted:•ICPs as active masses.•ICPs as conductance-enhancing additives.•ICPs as auxiliary materials beyond conductance.Research articleMultifunctional electrocatalysts derived from conducting polymer and metal organic framework complexesNano Energy, Volume 45, 2018, pp. 127-135Show abstractHigh cost, scarcity, and detrimental environmental effect of the noble-metal based catalysts have prompted the seek of less expensive, more benign, and earth abundant substitutes for energy conversion and storage. Here, we demonstrate a novel multifunctional electrocatalyst constructed by pyrolysis of the complex of polyaniline (PANI) and metal organic framework [Co-based MOF; zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67)]. The resultant PANI/ZIF-67 complex unveiled excellent electrocatalytic activities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. It was found that the catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 complex towards ORR, OER and HER could be tuned by simple changing the weight ratio of PANI to the MOF. Further, we tested the material as an air electrode for a primary zinc-air battery, demonstrating an open-circuit potential of 1.42\\xa0V and a peak power density of ~ 45\\xa0mW\\xa0cm−2 - both are superior to those of its counterpart of the Pt/C air-electrode. The excellent multifunctional catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 are mainly attributed to the synergistic combination of cobalt nanoparticles, Co3O4, and nitrogen doped carbon from the PANI/ZIF-67 complex after pyrolysis.Research articleProtective polymeric films for industrial substrates: A critical review on past and recent applications with conducting polymers and polymer composites/nanocompositesProgress in Materials Science, Volume 104, 2019, pp. 380-450Show abstractCorrosion defined as the deterioration of a material when it interacts with its environment is a global problem. Among the different strategies employed to combat corrosion, the use of coatings and corrosion inhibitors are the most popular. Coatings or corrosion inhibitors form a layer over the metallic substrate and protect it against corrosion. Polymers, both naturally occurring and synthetic have been tested for metal corrosion protection as replacement for the toxic inorganic and organic corrosion inhibitors. Interest in them stems from their availability, cost effectiveness, and eco-friendliness (especially for natural polymers) in addition to the inherent stability and multiple adsorption centers. However, it is found that most polymeric materials studied are moderate corrosion inhibitors. Several attempts such as copolymerization, addition of substances that exert synergistic effect, cross linking, blending, and most recently incorporation of inorganic substances in nano size into the polymer matrix have been made to improve the inhibition ability of polymers. In this review, the application of conducting polymers, polymer composites and nanocomposites for corrosion protection of different industrial metal substrates are explored based on reported experimental data and their mechanism of inhibition explained. Some identified drawbacks and future direction in this area have also been highlighted.View full textCopyright © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\\nTerms & Conditions\\nMost electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.

Fourth, the capture system can take advantage \\nof past advancements in fuel cells and water-splitting catalysts for \\nhigh energy efficiencies and easy scalability. Finally, our PSE device \\nenables a continuous, simultaneous and integrated carbon-capture \\nand release process, which differs from traditional absorption/desorp -\\ntion cycles and simplifies the carbon-capture system for many on-site \\napplications (Fig.\\xa0 1d).Concept verification\\nTo validate the proposed CO2-capture mechanism, we used commercial \\nPt/C and IrO2 as the electrocatalysts for ORR and OER, respectively29. \\nDifferent CO2:O2 ratios were used to establish a fundamental under -\\nstanding of the intrinsic CO2-separation performance of the system \\n(Methods and Supplementary Figs.\\xa02 and 3). As shown in Fig.\\xa02a, the \\nORR/OER I–V curves under different CO2 concentrations were similar, \\nsuggesting that the O2 concentration instead of the CO2 concentration \\ndetermines the cell activity. The onset potential (under 0.5\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2) \\nis around 0.8\\u2009V, including OER and ORR overpotentials (around 200–\\n300\\u2009mV each), ohmic drops and pH overpotentials during electrolysis3. \\nUnder high current density, at which O2 mass diffusion starts to affect \\nORR activity, the I –V curve (without iR compensations; Supplementary \\nFig.\\xa04) of 4.6%\\u2009CO2 showed slightly better cell voltage than that of 8.6% \\nor 13.9% owing to its higher O2 partial pressure.\\nUnder a constant ORR/OER electrolysis current, we can obtain the \\nCO2-capture rate, which is equivalent to the CO2 crossover rate, by meas -\\nuring the CO2 flow rate out of the PSE layer using water-displacement \\nand titration methods for both the gas-phase and dissolved CO2 \\n(Methods and Supplementary Figs.\\xa05–7). This CO2 dissolution can be \\navoided in practical operations by continuously recycling the deion -\\nized water stream. The CO2 bubble formation within the PSE layer \\nwas found to have little impact on the middle-layer pressure or the \\ndevice operational stability (Supplementary Fig.\\xa08). Furthermore, the \\nrecovered gas product was confirmed to be high-purity CO2 through \\ngas chromatography analysis (up to 99.7% without considering water \\nvapour; Supplementary Fig.\\xa09), allowing for direct integration with \\ndownstream utilization or storage processes without the typical \\nenergy-intensive secondary purification processes.

As shown in Fig.\\xa02b , with 13.9%\\u2009CO2 \\nconcentration, the CO2-capture rate increased almost linearly with the \\nORR current density ranging from 10 to 500\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2. By estimating the \\nslope of the CO2-capture (or crossover) rate as a function of the ORR \\ncurrent, we found that, for every two-electron transfer during which \\ntwo OH− ions were generated, there was one CO2 molecule captured, \\nsuggesting that the CO2 crossover is mainly through the carbonate ion \\ninstead of bicarbonate because of the high local interfacial pH. This \\nconclusion is supported by the well-matched CO2-capture rates with \\nthe theoretical guideline, which assumes 100% carbonate crossover \\nand is consistent with observations reported in previous studies5,16,18,30. \\nTherefore, here we defined the carbonate Faradaic efficiency (FEcarbon -\\nate) to better evaluate the carbon-capture efficiencies under different \\nreaction conditions (Methods). The FEcarbonate  was maintained over 90% \\nacross a wide range of cell currents under 13.9%\\u2009CO2, suggesting a high \\nutilization efficiency of generated OH− ions. However, at high current densities, FEcarbonate  showed a slight decrease owing to the competition \\nbetween the rate of carbonate formation and OH− migration. There \\nwere sufficient CO2 molecules around the catalyst–membrane interface \\nat low current densities to react rapidly with the generated OH− ions \\nbefore they were transported across the membrane by means of car -\\nbonate ions form. For high ORR currents, a large number of OH− ions  \\nwere generated, depleting the surrounding CO2 molecules at a fast rate. \\nThis limits the mass diffusion of CO2 and allows some OH− ions to move \\ndirectly across the AEM without reacting with CO2 molecules, resulting \\nin lowered FEs. Even with lower FEcarbonate , our solid-electrolyte reactor \\ndelivered an impressive carbon-capture rate of 3.34\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2 (or \\n0.137\\u2009mmolCO2\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2) at 500\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, which is equivalent to a rate \\nof about 86.7\\u2009kg\\u2009CO2\\u2009day−1\\u2009m−2. According to the reaction mechanism \\ndiscussed above, we can anticipate that the maximal current density \\nrequired to maintain high FEs would decrease with decreasing CO2 \\nconcentrations in the input gas owing to limited mass diffusion.

Please note that \\nthe choice of ion conduction in the solid electrolyte plays a critical role \\nin determining the cell voltage, particularly under high current density  \\n(Supplementary Fig.\\xa011).\\nIn principle, because ORR catalysis and CO2 capture are independent \\nprocesses, the O2 partial pressure should only affect the cell activity and \\nnot its carbon-capture rates or FEs3,4. As shown by the I–V curve com-\\nparison in Fig.\\xa0 2e, the solid-electrolyte reactor with air\\u2009+\\u200913.9%\\u2009CO2 pre -\\nsented similar ORR/OER electrolysis activities to that of O2\\u2009+\\u200913.9%\\u2009CO2 \\nat low currents, but required higher voltages at higher currents owing \\nto its lower O2 partial pressure. However, this cell-voltage difference \\ndid not affect the current efficiencies or CO2-capture rates (Fig.\\xa0 2f and \\nSupplementary Figs.\\xa012 and 13). To further test the carbon-capture \\ncapability and adaptability of our solid-electrolyte device, we lowered \\nthe feed CO2 levels to 6,200 and 2,950\\u2009ppm while evaluating the cell \\nperformance (Supplementary Fig.\\xa014). At low CO2 concentrations, the \\nmain limitation to the carbon-capture rate is the mass transport of \\nCO2 from the inlet flow to the catalyst–membrane interface, which is \\na common challenge for scaling up of all carbon-capture methods. As \\nshown in Fig.\\xa0 2g, the CO2-capture efficiency was maintained above 80% \\nwithin the current range 1–10\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 but rapidly decreased to around \\n50–60% when reaching 20–30\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2. This FE decrease is because of \\nthe mass-transfer limit of CO2 gas under this low-concentration condi -\\ntion, which became more prominent when the input CO2 concentration \\nwas further reduced to 2,950\\u2009ppm (Fig.\\xa0 2h). In this case, the FEcarbonate  \\ndecreased to about 55% under 10\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 current compared with 90% \\nin the case of 6,200\\u2009ppm. The observed FE trends imply that the opera -\\ntional current of the carbon-capture cell can be adjusted to suit different \\napplication scenarios, depending on the input CO2 concentrations, \\nwhile still maintaining high electron efficiencies.\\nIn practical scenarios, CO impurities are widely present in industrial \\nflue gas owing to incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, which \\ncould greatly affect the catalytic performance of the Pt catalyst because \\nof poisoning effects31,32. As shown in Fig.\\xa0 2i, the cell voltage under a \\nfixed current of 100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 showed an immediate increase when a CO \\nstream was mixed with the cathode gas input and continuously rose by \\nabout 300\\u2009mV within 10\\u2009h operation, suggesting a fast degradation of \\nPt/C ORR activity. The impurity poisoning effects on the Pt catalyst, as \\nwell as Pt scarcity and high cost, could limit the practical application \\nof our solid-electrolyte carbon-capture device.\\nThe impacts of different ORR catalysts\\nOne unique advantage of our carbon-capture device is the flexibility \\nin using different ORR and OER catalysts. Replacing the expensive \\nPt/C noble-metal catalyst with earth-abundant ORR catalysts can sub -\\nstantially reduce the materials cost; alternative ORR catalysts with \\ndifferent material properties could help mitigate the CO poisoning \\neffect observed on Pt/C. One promising candidate is the recently devel-\\noped transition-metal single-atom catalyst (SAC), such as Fe or Co \\nsingle-atomic sites coordinated in N-doped carbon33,34. These SACs \\npresented similar ORR performance to commercial Pt/C with high \\nresistance to CO poisoning owing to the weak interaction between CO \\nand the transition-metal centre35. Here we used Co-SAC as a representa -\\ntive ORR catalyst to investigate these possible advantages compared \\nwith Pt/C. Our Co-SAC was synthesized on the basis of a hard-template \\nmethod developed in our previous study, which guarantees high poros -\\nity and uniform distribution of metal single-atomic sites on the carbon \\nmatrix36 (Methods). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and \\nother characterization tools suggest an interconnected 3D porous \\nstructure of Co-SAC reversely templating from the SiO2 nanoparticle \\ntemplates (Fig.\\xa03a and Supplementary Figs.\\xa015–18). X-ray absorption \\nspectroscopy (XAS) confirmed the atomic dispersion of Co as shown in Fig.\\xa03b,c, in which only the Co–N coordination (located at around \\n1.4\\u2009Å) was observed in the spectrum and no Co–Co interactions (about \\n2.15\\u2009Å)37.\\nWe first evaluated the carbon-capture performance of our Co-SAC \\nunder a standard 13.9%\\u2009CO2 concentration. The I –V curve showed a \\nsimilar catalytic activity and FEcarbonate  compared with Pt/C catalyst \\n(Fig.\\xa03d and Supplementary Figs.\\xa019–21), suggesting the feasibility of \\nreplacing Pt/C noble-metal catalyst with earth-abundant materials. \\nDifferences became evident when we tuned the CO2 concentration \\nto 6,200\\u2009ppm, at which mass transport plays a more critical role in \\ndetermining carbon-capture performance. As shown in Fig.\\xa0 3e, the \\nCo-SAC maintained a high FE of more than 80% until 20\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, \\nunder which the Pt/C counterpart only achieved roughly 60% FE. \\nThe carbon-capture rate of Co-SAC was 0.12\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2 under \\n20\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, suggesting a more than 30% improvement compared with \\nPt/C (about 0.09\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2). The improvement ratio was further \\nenhanced to around 50% under 30\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2. Our Co-SAC can deliver \\n40\\u2009mA\\u2009m−2 current density with 60% FE and a carbon-capture rate of \\n0.18\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2 or 4.8\\u2009kgCO2\\u2009day−1\\u2009m−2, suggesting a highly efficient \\ncarbon capture considering this low-CO2-concentration source. Differ -\\nent from Pt/C catalyst with the active sites densely packed on the surface \\nof Pt nanoparticles, Co-SAC has uniformly dispersed active sites across \\nthe whole carbon matrix, which enables a more uniform generation of \\nOH− ions for a more efficient CO2 capture, especially when the CO2 mass \\ndiffusion is limited (Supplementary Fig.\\xa022). We further explored our \\nCo-SAC and PSE device carbon-capture limit by testing its direct air \\ncapture (DAC) performance (400\\u2009ppm CO2; Methods). As expected, the \\nORR current density to maintain high FEcarbonate  was decreased because \\nof the limited carbon mass diffusions under DAC conditions (Supple-\\nmentary Fig.\\xa023). Our reactor delivered almost 100% FEcarbonate  under \\na 0.5\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 ORR current. This represents a carbon-capture rate of \\n1.14\\u2009mg\\u2009m−2\\u2009s−1, comparable with the state-of-the-art DAC demonstra-\\ntion of about 1\\u2009mg\\u2009m−2\\u2009s−1(ref.\\u200938). Future improvements, including \\nlower-cost catalysts, electrodes and ion-exchange membranes, are \\nneeded to justify the scalability of our PSE reactor for DAC application \\nwhen compared with decoupled electrochemical/chemical reactions, \\nin which electrolysis could be operated under high current densities. \\nOur mass-transport simulation model and further DAC experiments \\non the impacts of pressure and catalyst-layer thickness lay the ground -\\nwork for different tuning knobs to enhance the device performance in \\nthe future (Supplementary Discussion\\xa01, Supplementary Table\\xa01 and \\nSupplementary Figs.\\xa024 and 25).\\nThe CO injection experiment shown in Fig.\\xa0 3f suggests the high \\nresistance of our Co-SAC to CO poisoning resulting from the weak \\ninteractions between the metal single-atomic sites and CO molecules32. \\nNo notable changes were observed in the cell voltage and FEs (>90%) when CO or other toxic gas (such as NO and SO\\n2) was injected into the \\ninput gas stream (Supplementary Fig.\\xa026). The potential for practical \\ncarbon-capture application was further demonstrated by the high \\nstability of Co-SAC in our solid-electrolyte device (Fig.\\xa03g and Sup -\\nplementary Figs.\\xa027 and 28), in which the cell voltage and FE remained \\nunchanged during the 72-h continuous carbon-capture operation \\nunder a fixed current density of 100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2.\\nTo make our study more practical, instead of using the above CO2–O2  \\nor CO2–air mixtures, we prepared simulated flue gas (13.9%\\u2009CO2, 7.8%\\u2009O2, \\n76.3%\\u2009N2 and 2.0%\\u2009H2O) as the gas input to our solid-electrolyte device. \\nA tandem reactor system, with two identical solid-electrolyte cells but \\noperated under two-stage current densities, was designed to deliver \\nboth high carbon-removal efficiencies and high FEs (Fig.\\xa0 3h).

We would like to emphasize \\nthat the PSE is an indispensable part of our carbon-capture device even \\nwith an ultrathin middle layer (Supplementary Fig.\\xa032).\\nSecond, the carbon-crossover efficiencies can be improved by means \\nof the formation of different types of anion. As discussed above, we \\nbelieve that the carbon crossover is through the carbonate ions, which \\nrequire two-electron transfer per captured CO2 molecule (0.5\\u2009CO2 per e−).  \\nOne possible alternative to improving the electron efficiency is estab -\\nlishing the CO2–H2O2 equilibrium42. Similar to the CO2–OH− reaction in \\nthe water system, CO2 can readily react with the HO2− anion from H2O2 \\nto form percarbonate (HCO4−)42. If we replace the 4e−-ORR catalyst in \\nour solid-electrolyte reactor with a 2e−-ORR catalyst7, we may obtain a \\nmaximal 50% increase in electron efficiencies. With every two-electron \\ntransfer, one OH− and one HO2− could form, which can transport 1.5\\u2009CO2 \\ngas molecules across the AEM (0.75\\u2009CO2 per e−; Fig.\\xa0 4d). To validate this \\nhypothesis, we used the Ni-SAC with a reasonable H2O2 selectivity in our \\nsolid-electrolyte reactor for carbon-capture tests (Fig.\\xa0 4e and Supple -\\nmentary Figs.\\xa033–36). As shown in Fig.\\xa0 4f, the carbon-capture rates on \\nNi-SAC suggested a notable increase compared with 4e−-ORR catalysts \\ndemonstrated above. Under 100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2 current density, the 4e−-ORR \\ncatalyst presented a carbon-capture rate of around 0.7\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2, \\nwhereas the Ni-SAC delivered a rate of 1.05\\u2009ml\\u2009min−1\\u2009cm−2. The increased \\ncarbon-capture rates were carefully confirmed by excluding the pos-\\nsibility of O2 gas bubbles from H2O2 self-decomposition in the PSE \\nlayer or any impacts of H2O2 on titrations (Supplementary Discus -\\nsion\\xa02 and Supplementary Figs.\\xa037 and 38). By calculating the number \\nof CO2 molecules captured per electron transferred, instead of using \\nthe above-defined FEcarbonate  resulting from the multianion crossover \\nmechanism involved, a promising 0.71\\u2009CO2 per e− was achieved under \\n100\\u2009mA\\u2009cm−2, compared with 0.47\\u2009CO2 per e− in the case of 4e−-ORR \\n(Fig.\\xa0 4f). Using other 2e−-ORR catalysts, including oxidized carbon \\nblack (OCB) and Fe-SAC (Supplementary Figs.\\xa039 and 40), we showed \\nthat the carbon-capture electron efficiency linearly scales with H2O2 \\nselectivity under the same current density, further demonstrating the \\nimprovement of HO2− ions in transporting CO2 molecules (Fig.\\xa0 4g). We \\ncan also exclude the possibility of bicarbonate crossover in the case of \\nH2O2, which could also improve the electron efficiencies (Supplemen -\\ntary Discussion\\xa03).\\nThe improvements in cell voltages and electron efficiencies dis -\\ncussed above can further reduce the carbon-capture cost of our device.  \\nA techno-economic analysis based on previously reported models and \\nthe performance of our device (Figs.\\xa02  and 3 ) suggests a base cost of \\nabout $83 per ton of captured CO2 (refs.\\u200943 ,44) (Fig.\\xa0 4h, Supplemen -\\ntary Fig.\\xa041, Supplementary Discussion\\xa04 and Supplementary Table\\xa02).  \\nBy taking into consideration the demonstrated improvements, \\nincluding a thinner PSE layer (Fig.\\xa0 4b) and higher electron efficien -\\ncies (Fig.\\xa04f ), the estimated cost can be reduced to about $58 per ton \\nand can be more attractive if the value of generated H2O2 was included. \\nConsidering this very initial study with each component to be further \\nimproved and optimized in future research, our solid-electrolyte \\ncarbon-capture reactor represents a competitive, promising and sus-\\ntainable strategy for carbon management. For example, we can switch \\nto other facile redox couples in different application scenarios, such \\nas hydrogen evolution reaction/hydrogen oxidation reaction (HER/\\nHOR) or organic and inorganic molecular redox couples, to further \\nreduce the overpotentials. Further improvements of the ohmic drops \\nof the reactor can be expected with a thinner middle layer and more \\nconductive solid-electrolyte particles. Other operation parameters, \\nsuch as temperature for better reaction kinetics and pressure for bet-\\nter mass transport, could also be implemented for different appli -\\ncation scenarios (Supplementary Figs.\\xa042 and 43). The mentioned \\nimprovements could bring the carbon-capture cost down to about  \\n$33 per ton.Conclusion\\nGiven various electrochemical redox reactions available with proton–\\nelectron coupling processes (HER/HOR, quinone redox couples, flow \\nbattery redox couples and so on), our solid-electrolyte reactor sets \\nup a versatile carbon-capture platform that could be implemented \\nin many practical scenarios in the future. It is worth noting that many \\nelectrochemical redox couples, such as HER/HOR, present much better \\nreaction kinetics and lower overpotentials than the OER/ORR cou -\\nple we demonstrated in this work, which can substantially reduce the \\ncell-operation voltage and improve the carbon-capture efficiencies. \\nVarious cell and operation parameters, such as the thickness of the \\nsolid-electrolyte layer, operation temperature and pressure, redox cou -\\nple catalyst improvements and reaction pathway tuning, can be further \\noptimized as future research directions to improve the carbon-capture \\nenergy efficiencies and costs for practical deployments.\\nOnline content\\nAny methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summa -\\nries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowl -\\nedgements, peer review information; details of author contributions \\nand competing interests; and statements of data and code availability \\nare available at https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06060-1.\\n1.

Introduction\\nRecent estimates report that CO 2emissions in the world were more than 33 Gton in\\n2018 [ 1]. In order to decrease greenhouse gas emissions, several international agreements\\nwere signed: the Conference of the Parties (COP21) held at Paris on the 12 December 2015\\nwas a milestone because 197 Countries agreed to keep the temperature increase below\\n2/1.5\\x0eC above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century [ 2]. This aim was conﬁrmed\\nby the following Conference of Parties (COP22) held at Marrakesh in 2016, where the\\nnational determined contribution (NDC) was deﬁned [ 3]. However, in order to achieve this\\nobjective, CO 2conventional mitigation, meaning a reduction in CO 2emissions, might be\\nnot enough and the removal of CO 2might be required, resulting in negative emissions [ 4,5].\\nFor this reason, negative emissions technologies (NETs) also known as carbon dioxide\\nremoval (CDR) technologies, will have a crucial role in the coming years to achieve the\\nCO 2level deﬁned by the environmental agreements and stabilize the CO 2concentration\\nbetween 350 and 440 ppm [6,7].\\nNegative emissions technologies are deﬁned as the intentional human effort to remove\\nCO 2emissions from the atmosphere and include the following: afforestation and reforesta-\\ntion (AR), soil carbon sequestration (SCS), biochar (BC), bioenergy with carbon capture and\\nstorage (BECCS), direct air capture (DAC), enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization\\n(EW) and ocean fertilization (OF) [ 8]. Among these solutions, the research community has\\nbeen focused for the most part on DAC, due to its advantages [9].\\nDAC was used for decades to produce CO 2-free air to support life in submarines and\\nspacecraft systems [ 10,11]; it was presented by Lackner as a GHG mitigation technology\\nonly in 1999 [ 12]. DAC captures CO 2from the atmosphere to store it as part of a CDR\\nprocess in the long term (direct air carbon capture and storage—DACCS). Integrated\\nDAC systems have also been studied to supply climate-neutral CO 2for chemical processes\\nAppl.

DAC Technologies\\nIn this section, an overview of DAC technologies is set forth. Absorption, adsorption,\\nion exchange resin, mineral carbonation, membrane, photocatalysis, cryogenic separation,\\nelectrochemical and electrodialysis approaches are investigated.Appl. Sci. 2022 ,12, 8321 4 of 41\\n2.1. Absorption\\nIn absorption technology for DAC, water solutions of strong bases containing hydrox-\\nide sorbents with a strong CO 2afﬁnity, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium\\nhydroxide (KOH) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2), are used [ 3]. The absorption with\\nCa(OH) 2was proposed by Lackner et al. [ 12] and it follows the reactions described be-\\nlow [18] (see Equations (2)–(4)):\\nCa(OH)2+CO 2!CaCO 3+H2ODH25\\x0eC=\\x00109 kJ/mol (2)\\nCaCO 3!CaO +CO 2DH900\\x0eC= + 179.2 kJ/mol (3)\\nCaO +H2O!Ca(OH)2DH\\x0e\\n100\\x0eC=\\x0064.5 kJ/mol (4)\\nThe reaction starts with calcium hydroxide and CO 2to form calcium carbonate\\n(CaCO 3). The obtained calcium carbonate is precipitated, accumulated, separated from\\nwater, dried and calcined above 900\\x0eC. In this step, calcium oxide (CaO) and CO 2(con-\\ncentrated stream) are obtained. Afterwards, calcium oxide is hydrated to produce calcium\\nhydroxide. This reaction scheme allows a closed cycle. However, there are some disadvan-\\ntages to this process, such as the great amount of lost water, high temperatures and high\\nrequired energies for the calcination step (179.2 kJ/mol), and the low solubility of calcium\\nhydroxide in water, which limits the hydroxide concentration for CO 2capture [3,18].\\nThe use of NaOH water solution was proposed by Baciocchi et al. [ 37] and has a\\nsimilarity to the Kraft process used in the paper industry to extract cellulose from wood.\\nCompared to Ca(OH) 2, NaOH solution allows a strong binding of CO 2but with a higher\\nsolubility of carbonate in water. In this process, there are two cycles working simultaneously.\\nIn the ﬁrst, CO 2is captured by NaOH to produce sodium carbonate (Na 2CO 3) in the\\nabsorber through an exothermic reaction evolving at ambient temperature and pressure (see\\nEquation (5)). In the second cycle, known as the regeneration cycle, NaOH is regenerated\\nin the causticizer/precipitator: Na 2CO 3reacts with Ca(OH) 2to produce NaOH and CaCO 3\\n(see Equation (6)). From calcium carbonate, CO 2(concentrated stream) is recovered in the\\ncalciner/kiln (see Equation (7)) and receives oxygen (O 2) from an air separation unit. As\\nmentioned above, this step requires a lot of energy, with temperatures above 900\\x0eC to\\nallow the removal of water and decomposition of CaCO 3. Afterwards, CaO is hydrated to\\nCa(OH) 2in the slaker (see Equation (8)) so that it can be sent to the precipitator to be used\\nagain [18]. Figure 3 shows the scheme of this process.\\nAbsorber 2Na(OH)+CO 2!Na2CO 3+H2ODH25\\x0eC=\\x00109.4 kJ/mol (5)\\nCausticizer Na 2CO 3+Ca(OH)2!2Na(OH)+CaCO 3DH100\\x0eC=\\x005.3 kJ/mol (6)\\nCalciner CaCO 3!CaO +CO 2DH900\\x0eC= + 179.2 kJ/mol (7)\\nSlaker CaO +H2O!Ca(OH)2DH100\\x0eC=\\x0064.5 kJ/mol (8)Appl.

In addition to this high energy requirement, the water loss\\n(water before calcination in the calciner must be removed) is an additional disadvantage\\nof the process.

[ 53] built an\\nabsorber prototype for the Carbon Engineering company to test the cross ﬂow and PVC\\npacking, to evaluate energy requirements and fouling by atmospheric particulates and to\\nassess technical and safety risks.\\n2.2. Adsorption\\nWhile the absorption process mainly uses an aqueous solution of NaOH, KOH or\\nCa(OH) 2, the adsorption process is based on the chemical or physical adsorption of CO 2\\nwith particular sorbents, such as amine-functionalized sorbents, metal organic frameworks\\n(MOFs), zeolites, etc. [6]. Among chemisorbents, amine-functionalized sorbents and solid\\nalkali carbonates sorbents (bulk and supported) have been proposed, while, among ph-\\nysisorbents, MOFs, zeolites and new materials, such as boron nitride nanosheets and\\nnanotubes, have been investigated [ 18]. Amine-functionalized sorbents have received sig-\\nniﬁcant attention for DAC systems due to their stability under humidity, low regeneration\\ntemperatures (50–120\\x0eC) and ﬂexibility in the choice of low-cost support [39].\\nGenerally, in the adsorption system, a single equipment unit is used, where adsorption\\nand desorption happen alternately after variations in temperature or pressure or a combi-\\nnation of the two. Generally, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is not practicable in a real\\nprocess because a pressure lower than 0.4 mbar is required. At lab scale, the temperature\\nswing adsorption (TSA) is generally used, but the use of an inert gas purge results in\\na dilute output stream. On the other hand, temperature and vacuum swing adsorption\\n(TVSA) could be used to produce a high-CO 2purity stream.\\nMost studies reported in the literature on the adsorption process are on the investigation\\nof sorbents, evaluating adsorption capacities and performances, as discussed below.\\n2.2.1. Physisorbents\\nPhysisorption occurs between the sorbent surface and CO 2, allowing only a physical\\ninteraction. Generally, materials with porosity or nanometric dimensions, such as zeolites,\\nactivated carbon, MOFs and new materials, have been considered [ 54]. Activated carbons\\nare characterized by low cost and high thermal stability, showing an adsorption capacity\\nand selectivity lower than that of zeolites at a low CO 2partial pressure but higher at a high\\nCO 2partial pressure [ 55,56]. For this reason, activated carbons are not a good choice for\\ndirect air capture [6].\\nFactors inﬂuencing the CO 2capture of zeolites are size, charge density and distribution\\nof cations in the porous structure [ 57]. Humidity has a negative effect on CO 2capture, and\\nfor this reason zeolites are not suggested for direct air capture [6].\\nMOFs are characterized by ﬂexibility in shape, pore structure, pore size and surface\\nproperties [ 58]. Similar to activated carbons, adsorption capacity and selectivity are lower\\nat low CO 2partial pressures and in the presence of humidity; MOFs are suitable for CO 2\\nstorage and not for CO 2separation. However, in recent years, attention has been directed\\nto MOFs (particularly MIL-101(Cr)) functionalized with amine (adsorption of amines onto\\nmetal sites or physical impregnation with liquid amines) which provide better performances\\nfor CO 2capture from the air due to their durability under moist conditions [ 39]. Currently,\\nthe high cost of MOFs makes their use in DAC prohibitive [6].Appl.

These materials have the ability to capture\\nCO 2from the air due to the introduction of electrons and to spontaneously desorb CO 2\\nwhen electrons are removed.\\nGenerally, adsorption with physisorbents is characterized by a low adsorption capacity\\ndue to the dilute concentration of CO 2in the air and the negative effect of moisture.

The topics covered include: electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes (quinone–hydroquinone redox couple, organic compounds of analytical interest, various electroorganic reactions, inorganic ions), electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metals, heterogeneous catalysis and electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.IntroductionSince the discovery of the organic conducting polymers more than 20 years ago, these materials are finding an increasing use in various branches of technology, such as metallization of dielectrics, primary and secondary batteries, antistatic coatings, electromagnetic shielding, electrochromic systems, etc. One of the most striking properties of conducting polymers is their ability to catalyze some electrode reactions. A thin layer of a conducting polymer, deposited onto the surface of substrate electrode, is able to enhance the kinetics of electrode processes of some solution species. These electrocatalytic processes, proceeding at conducting polymer electrodes, present a fast growing area of investigation, which may yield many unexpected applications in various fields of applied electrochemistry.The present paper presents a short review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, emphasizing the activities of the past few years. The material published on this topic may be divided into two main groups. One of these groups deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymer modified electrodes, not containing any additional catalytically active substances. Within this group, the two subgroups are reviewed separately, one of them dealing with electrocatalysis of organic substances (subdivided further according to some groups of electroorganic reactions), and another one considering the electrocatalytic properties of conducting polymers towards inorganic ions. The second group deals with electrocatalysis at conducting polymers, containing other active substances. These systems are divided according to the nature of these additional substances: dispersed metal particles, heteropolyanions, and various metal complexes.In our knowledge, no review on electrocatalysis at conducting polymers has been published. Thus, we hope that the present short review, although not exhaustive, can help in introducing into this fast growing research area.Section snippetsElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodesAt conducting polymer modified electrodes, at least three processes should be considered, taking place during electrocatalytic conversion of solution species. One of them is a heterogeneous electron transfer between the electrode and a conducting polymer layer, and electron transfer within the polymer film. As usual, this process is accompanied by the movement of charge compensating anions and solvent molecules within the conducting polymer film, and possible conformational changes of polymerElectrocatalysis at conducting polymer electrodes, modified with dispersed metalsNoble metal based catalysts are widely used in industry. The catalytic activity of these metals is known to depend highly on their dispersity and surface properties. As usual, for many catalytic processes, a high degree of dispersity and large surface area are desirable. Conducting polymers are often considered to be useful matrices for the immobilization of the dispersed noble metal catalysts. Porous structure and high surface area of many conducting polymers favours their use as supportingElectrocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis at conducting polymers, doped with heteropolyanionsMost of the known conducting polymers are anion-doped in their conducting form. PANI is able to bind reversibly many small anions upon its oxidation from leucoemeraldine to emeraldine form, and to expell them back into the bulk solution on the back reduction, performed either electrochemically, or by the chemical means. Adversely, POPD is anion-doped in its reduced state, whereas small anions are expelled from the polymer film during its electrochemical oxidation. Reversible doping-dedopingElectrocatalysis at conducting polymers, doped with various metal complexesIn principle, a wide variety of anions can be included by doping into conducting polymers. If these anions are catalytically or electrocatalytically active, new composite catalyst materials can be obtained, whose properties will be determined not only by catalytically active dopants, but also, by the presence of the conducting polymer matrix.Metal phthalocyanine complexes are well known electrocatalysts, especially in electroreduction of molecular oxygen.

It was comprised of a three-dimensional (3D) porous underlayer of nickel nanoparticles with a size of less than 35\\xa0nm, followed by an electrodeposited top layer of poly (aniline-co-pyrrole). The underlayer and top coating were both synthesized by applying a constant potential to a three-electrode system. The catalyst characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry. The electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated electrodes was measured by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and chronopotentiometry. The electrode exhibited an overpotential of 520\\xa0mV at a current density of 10\\xa0mA\\xa0cm−2, comparable to 530\\xa0mV of platinum. Furthermore, the Tafel slope of the electrode was 90\\xa0mV dec−1, almost equal to that of platinum. This exceptional performance was explained by the synergistic interaction between 3D-Ni and poly (aniline-co-pyrrole) layers. Such a synergism was demonstrated by the fact that the resulting electrode lacked substantial catalytic activity when each of these two layers was deposited on the substrate alone. The Nyquist diagrams revealed that the 3D-Ni film resulted in minimal charge transfer resistance, allowing fast kinetics of HER. The coupling of this property with the ability of the polymer to adsorb H+ ions led to the high electrocatalytic activity of the proposed electrode. This electrode performed better than platinum, which was a promising result. This indicated that a lower voltage input was required to generate hydrogen gas using the prepared electrode.A polypyrrole hybrid thin film with [sn(dmit)<inf>3</inf>]<sup>2−</sup>, [tris(1,3-dithiole-2-thione-4,5-dithiolate)stannate]<sup>2−</sup>: Surface analysis2023, Applied Surface ScienceShow abstractIt is essential to understand the formation of the interface and the morphological design of the surface of electrodes and devices to control the structure and adapt the material to different applications. To study the interface, thin films of a PPy/[Sn(dmit)3]2 were electrochemically grown with the aid of a microcell typically used in scanning tunneling microscopy assays. Raman and FTIR spectroscopies showed the effect of dimensionality on those materials, especially on the vibrational modes of dmit ring and on the 75\\xa0nm thick PPy/[Sn (dmit)3]2 film, which presents an optimized polymer chain conjunction length and a 20\\xa0% greater contribution to the polaron charge carriers. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analyses confirmed the polaron/bipolaron ratio data, allowing us to determine other contributions to the surface charge density. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images show the hybrid thin film's different growth modes and the roughness evolution as a function of the electrochemical signal used in the synthesis.Acetylcholinesterase modified inkjet-printed graphene/gold nanoparticle/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) hybrid electrode for ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection2023, BioelectrochemistryShow abstractThis study successfully created a portable acetylcholinesterase sensor on a printed hybrid electrode capable of detecting chlorpyrifos in the field. While a screen-printed electrode was chosen herein to enable a single-use and portable platform for the in-field application, the hybrid material was incorporated to ensure ultrasensitive detection at lower electrode potentials. The hybrid ink of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated on graphene (GP) sheets in poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was synthesized through a simple completely-green one-pot process. The subsequent characterization was carried out via transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The synergy resulting from the greater surface area and enhanced transfer of electrons combined with high levels of electrocatalytic activity and superb conductivity offered by GP, AuNP, and PEDOT:PSS allows the sensor to exhibit ultrasensitive chlorpyrifos detection at the relatively low detection limit of 0.07\\xa0nM. The sensor demonstrated in this study also exhibits good reproducibility, desirable stability, and a successful application for the real sample with satisfactory recovery results of around 106\\xa0%, indicating its potential for use as a tool in the analysis of pesticides.Enzyme based bioelectrocatalysis over laccase immobilized poly-thiophene supported carbon fiber paper for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone2022, Molecular CatalysisShow abstractA modified electrode based on laccase immobilized poly-thiophene-3-carboxylic acid supported on carbon fiber paper was developed for the electrocatalytic oxidation of D-ribofuranose to otherwise difficult-to-access D-ribonolactone, a precursor for C-nucleoside based drug like Remdesivir. The electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuranose was achieved by the TEMPO-mediated electrochemical process. The experimental parameters were optimized and validated using Design of Experiment (DoE) statistical tool indicating the concentration of TEMPO and stirring as important parameters in bulk electrolysis. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation of D-ribofuronose followed single electron anodic oxidation of TEMPO mediated by laccase to the corresponding oxoammonium nitrosonium species which was vital for the mediated electrochemical oxidation. The mechanism for the electrochemical oxidation was established using cyclic voltammetry and computational studies. The plausible interactions of laccase enzyme with TEMPO mediator were studied using molecular docking experiments. This facile method was successfully applied for the oxidation of D-ribofuranose to D-ribonolactone.Electropolymerized melamine for simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine2020, Food ChemistryShow abstractPoly(melamine) (PMel) was synthesized via the electropolymerization of melamine monomer, which was then characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The possible polymerization mechanisms of melamine were also revealed by FT-IR spectroscopy and UV–Vis spectroscopy. Next, the PMel modified GCE (PMel/GCE) was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite (NO2−) and tartrazine, and the parameters were optimized. The kinetic study showed that the electrochemical oxidation of nitrite and tartrazine at the surface of PMel/GCE is a typical surface-controlled electrode process. Under the optimun conditions, the developed sensor outperformed those previously reported, and it also exhibited high selectivity and reproducibility. Finally, the PMel/GCE was used for the simultaneous determination of nitrite and tartrazine in foodstuffs, and the results indicated that the proposed sensor could be a promising candidate for accurate determination of nitrite and tartrazine in real food samples.The role of electrolytically deposited palladium and platinum metal nanoparticles dispersed onto poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene) for enhanced glucose electrooxidation in biofuel cells2020, Electrochimica ActaShow abstractGlucose biofuel cells are one of the promising power supplies with a competent long-term stability and power density. In this respect, catalysts of palladium (Pd) and platinum (Pt) metal nanoparticles film coated electrode were fabricated for biofuel cell. The Pt and Pd particles were electrochemically deposited onto glassy carbon (GC) electrode modified with poly(1,8-diaminonaphthalene), (p-1,8-DAN), via single or layer-by-layer electrodeposition. In results, Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC, Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC and Pd-Pt/p-1,8-DAN/GC shell-core catalysts were fabricated and characterized by several analytical techniques such as AFM, EDX,SEM, TEM, and XPS, in addition to electrochemical methods. Their catalytic electrooxidation behaviors of glucose were investigated in alkaline medium. The as-prepared nano-catalysts showed improved electrocatalytic performances and better stability for glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) due to the presence of metal nanoparticles. The Pd as core and Pt as shell in Pt-Pd/p-1,8-DAN/GC catalyst exhibited higher electrochemically accessible surface area (157.58 m2/g) and a favored electrooxidation efficiency. Moreover, the bimetallic Pt-Pd shell-core electrode showed higher resistance to poisoning (tolerance 1.24) and a decrease in the onset potential to -0.28\\xa0V. These multipurpose electro-catalysts are a potential candidate for developing a novel glucose biofuel cell.View all citing articles on ScopusResearch articleRecent advances in the synthesis of conducting polymers from the vapour phaseProgress in Materials Science, Volume 86, 2017, pp. 127-146Show abstractInherently conducting polymers (ICPs) combine the electrical properties of metals and semiconductors with a polymer’s ability to flex and/or stretch. In general, polymers are relatively simple to synthesise, however, ICPs themselves have had limited uptake in consumer devices. This lack of uptake is in part related to the insolubility of many ICPs in common industrial solvents, and hence methods to manufacture them in a usable form have been problematic. Vapour phase polymerisation (VPP) is one method that provides a convenient route to producing thin films of both soluble and insoluble ICPs, and nanocomposites thereof. In this critical review the VPP process will be discussed from the fundamental viewpoint of the proposed polymerisation mechanism and the parameters affecting polymer growth for a range of different monomers (thiophene, 3-hexylthiophene, pyrrole, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, etc.). Looking forward into the future, new areas of polymer design and fabrication using VPP will be discussed, such as the enhancement of ICPs through additives, and next generation device fabrication based upon VPP ICPs.Research articleConducting polymeric nanocomposites: A review in solar fuel applicationsFuel, Volume 325, 2022, Article 124899Show abstractOver the last few decades, research is being carried out in the field of photocatalysis to investigate for fuels production in sustainable manner. Due to an energy depletion and CO2 emission in the current situation urge us to produce alternative fuels. Water splitting and the reduction of carbon dioxide using various photocatalysts are being developed as promising sustainable methods to obtain eco-friendly energy sources. Conducting polymers (CP) stand out among the current pool of studied photocatalysts due to their high light absorption efficiency, good stability, tunable electronic characteristics, and cost effectiveness. Various CP, such as polyaniline, polythiophene, and polypyrrole have been integrated with different semiconducting nanomaterials to produce photocatalytic composites. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the synthesis of CP and their nanocomposites for application in CO2 photoreduction and water splitting into fuel production using different polymeric composites. Many composite photocatalysts show synergistic effects between the polymeric material and other counterparts in the composite. The improvement in the inactivity of the composite can be attributed to the band configurations of the composite. Improving the separation of excitons, widening the light absorption region, enhancing the substrate adsorption, and preventing photocorrosion conductive polymers can significantly increase the photocatalytic activity under visible light. The addition of conducting polymers with an inorganic materials dramatically change their band positions and may reduce the possiblilty of electron hole recombination. Here, we explain by what means conductive polymeric material can improve the efficiency of the composite in an organized manner, thereby providing a comprehensive reference to the field. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of polymeric catalysts have been discussed briefly.Research articlePolyaniline/polyvinyl alcohol blends: Effect of sulfonic acid dopants on microstructural, optical, thermal and electrical propertiesSynthetic Metals, Volume 191, 2014, pp. 126-134Show abstractThis correspondence reports the preparation and performance of different polyaniline–polyvinyl blends (PANI–PVA) doped with sulfonated acids. PANI is prepared by in situ dispersion polymerisation, and a subsequent extensive study determines the effect of protonation upon doping with four different types of acids. We obtain the blends by changing the four different dopants, viz. β-naphtalenesulfonic acid (NSA), camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) and p-toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA), while maintaining constant PANI and PVA concentrations. The polymer thin films are deposited on glass substrates by the dip-cast procedure. Lastly, the films of the obtained blends are characterised by surface, structural morphology (elemental analysis, AFM, SEM, FTIR and XRD), thermal properties (TGA and DSC) and UV–vis spectroscopy. The morphological analysis shows that the nanoparticles form different shapes, which depend on the type of dopant, whereas the FTIR spectra show the chemical interaction between the two polymers. The thermal study reveals three-step degradation of the polymer blends. To confirm the possible use of these blends in the electrical industry, the electrical properties are studied by in-plane I–V characteristics and four probe conductivity measurements.Research articleIntrinsically conducting polymers in electrochemical energy technology: Trends and progressElectrochimica Acta, Volume 122, 2014, pp. 93-107Show abstractThe use of intrinsically conducting polymers (ICPs) like polythiophene (PTh), polypyrrole (PPy) and polyaniline (PANI) in devices and systems for electrochemical energy storage and conversion is briefly reviewed with a focus on an overview distinguishing between already established uses and potential applications. Basic principles in these three major fields are highlighted:•ICPs as active masses.•ICPs as conductance-enhancing additives.•ICPs as auxiliary materials beyond conductance.Research articleMultifunctional electrocatalysts derived from conducting polymer and metal organic framework complexesNano Energy, Volume 45, 2018, pp. 127-135Show abstractHigh cost, scarcity, and detrimental environmental effect of the noble-metal based catalysts have prompted the seek of less expensive, more benign, and earth abundant substitutes for energy conversion and storage. Here, we demonstrate a novel multifunctional electrocatalyst constructed by pyrolysis of the complex of polyaniline (PANI) and metal organic framework [Co-based MOF; zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67)]. The resultant PANI/ZIF-67 complex unveiled excellent electrocatalytic activities towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline medium. It was found that the catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 complex towards ORR, OER and HER could be tuned by simple changing the weight ratio of PANI to the MOF. Further, we tested the material as an air electrode for a primary zinc-air battery, demonstrating an open-circuit potential of 1.42\\xa0V and a peak power density of ~ 45\\xa0mW\\xa0cm−2 - both are superior to those of its counterpart of the Pt/C air-electrode. The excellent multifunctional catalytic activities of the PANI/ZIF-67 are mainly attributed to the synergistic combination of cobalt nanoparticles, Co3O4, and nitrogen doped carbon from the PANI/ZIF-67 complex after pyrolysis.Research articleProtective polymeric films for industrial substrates: A critical review on past and recent applications with conducting polymers and polymer composites/nanocompositesProgress in Materials Science, Volume 104, 2019, pp. 380-450Show abstractCorrosion defined as the deterioration of a material when it interacts with its environment is a global problem. Among the different strategies employed to combat corrosion, the use of coatings and corrosion inhibitors are the most popular. Coatings or corrosion inhibitors form a layer over the metallic substrate and protect it against corrosion. Polymers, both naturally occurring and synthetic have been tested for metal corrosion protection as replacement for the toxic inorganic and organic corrosion inhibitors. Interest in them stems from their availability, cost effectiveness, and eco-friendliness (especially for natural polymers) in addition to the inherent stability and multiple adsorption centers. However, it is found that most polymeric materials studied are moderate corrosion inhibitors. Several attempts such as copolymerization, addition of substances that exert synergistic effect, cross linking, blending, and most recently incorporation of inorganic substances in nano size into the polymer matrix have been made to improve the inhibition ability of polymers. In this review, the application of conducting polymers, polymer composites and nanocomposites for corrosion protection of different industrial metal substrates are explored based on reported experimental data and their mechanism of inhibition explained. Some identified drawbacks and future direction in this area have also been highlighted.View full textCopyright © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.

In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\n",

The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30 percent loss of capacity after 7000 cycles.\n",

      "Get e-AlertsAbstractCurrent methods for CO2 capture and concentration (CCC) are energy intensive due to their reliance on thermal cycles, which are intrinsically Carnot limited in efficiency. In contrast, electrochemically driven CCC (eCCC) can operate with much higher theoretical efficiencies. However, most reported systems are sensitive to O2, precluding their practical use. In order to achieve O2-stable eCCC, we pursued the development of molecular redox carriers with reduction potentials positive of the O2/O2– redox couple. Prior efforts to chemically modify redox carriers to operate at milder potentials resulted in diminished CO2 binding. To overcome these limitations, we used common alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-p-benzoquinone (TCQ), by up to 350 mV, conferring O2 stability. Intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions with the dianion and CO2-bound forms of TCQ were correlated to alcohol pKa to identify ethanol as the optimal additive, as it imparts beneficial changes to both the reduction potential and CO2-binding constant, the two key properties of eCCC redox carriers. We demonstrated a full cycle of eCCC in aerobic simulated flue gas using TCQ and ethanol, two commercially available compounds. Based on the system properties, an estimated minimum of 21 kJ/mol is required to concentrate CO2 from 10 to 100% or twice as efficient as state-of-the-art thermal amine capture systems and other reported redox carrier-based systems. Furthermore, this approach of using hydrogen-bond donor additives is general and can be used to tailor the redox properties of other quinone/alcohol combinations for specific CO2-capture applications.Supporting InformationARTICLE SECTIONSJump ToAbstractSupporting InformationThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c04044.Materials and methods; quinone reduction potentials and CO2-binding constants; cyclic voltammograms; relationship between reduction potential and CO2-binding constants; plot of E(TCQ●–/ TCQ2−)1/2 versus pKa (H2O); electrochemical data; variable scan rate cyclic voltammograms; redox potentials and peak–peak separation; electronic absorption spectra; 13C{1H} NMR spectra; FTIR spectra; normalized electronic absorption spectra; plots of Log(KCO2) for TCQ versus Log([ROH]); plots of F(ΔE1/2) versus Log([ROH]); measured Henry’s law constants; example photos of the bulk electrolysis H-cell; measured and calculated values for an eCCC cycle; calculated moles of free CO2; charge versus time plots; thermodynamic values; and reduction potentials and estimated minimum energetic requirements (PDF)ja2c04044_si_001.pdf (1.8 MB)\n",

      "The purpose of this research proposal is to develop a more efficient carbon capture system by leveraging the findings from a recent research paper on oxygen-stable electrochemical CO2 capture and concentration with quinones using alcohol additives. The goal is to address the key problem of sensitivity to oxygen in the initial approach and improve the overall efficiency of the carbon capture process.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Background and current state:\n",
      "The initial approach is a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system that utilizes an electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone-carbon nanotube composite negative electrode for CO2 capture. However, the system is sensitive to oxygen, which reduces its efficiency. The research paper's findings demonstrate that the addition of alcohol additives can anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, resulting in an oxygen-stable electrochemical CO2 capture system with improved efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Hypothesis:\n",
      "We hypothesize that by incorporating the research paper's findings on using alcohol additives to anodically shift the reduction potential of a quinone redox carrier, we can develop an oxygen-stable electrochemical CO2 capture system that is more efficient than the initial approach in terms of GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Methodology:\n",
      "The proposed methodology involves synthesizing a quinone redox carrier and optimizing its properties through the addition of alcohol additives. The electrochemical behavior of the redox carrier will be characterized using techniques such as cyclic voltammetry and electronic absorption spectroscopy. The CO2 capture performance of the system will be evaluated using a parallel passage contactor bed setup, similar to the initial approach. The system will be tested under various conditions, including different CO2 concentrations and oxygen levels, to assess its stability and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Expected outcomes:\n",
      "We expect that by incorporating the research paper's findings, the proposed system will exhibit improved faradaic efficiency, higher capture capacity, and enhanced durability compared to the initial approach. The system is expected to achieve a higher GJ energy/ton of CO2 captured, making it more efficient for carbon capture applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Biggest risks and ways to mitigate those risks:\n",
      "The biggest risk is the potential for the alcohol additives to negatively affect the overall performance of the system or introduce unwanted side reactions. To mitigate this risk, a thorough characterization of the redox carrier and alcohol additives will be conducted to understand their interactions and optimize their concentrations. Additionally, careful control of the experimental conditions, such as oxygen levels and CO2 concentrations, will be implemented to minimize any potential adverse effects. Regular monitoring and analysis of the system's performance will also be carried out to identify and address any issues that may arise.\n"

    "Initial approach description:\n",
    "We report a solid-state faradaic electro-swing reactive adsorption system comprising an electrochemical cell that exploits the reductive addition of CO2 to quinones for carbon capture. The reported device is compact and flexible, obviates the need for ancillary equipment, and eliminates the parasitic energy losses by using electrochemically activated redox carriers. An electrochemical cell with a polyanthraquinone–carbon nanotube composite negative electrode captures CO2 upon charging via the carboxylation of reduced quinones, and releases CO2 upon discharge. The cell architecture maximizes the surface area exposed to gas, allowing for ease of stacking of the cells in a parallel passage contactor bed. We demonstrate the capture of CO2 both in a sealed chamber and in an adsorption bed from inlet streams of CO2 concentrations as low as 0.6% (6000 ppm) and up to 10%, at a constant CO2 capacity with a faradaic efficiency of >90%, and a work of 40–90 kJ per mole of CO2 captured, with great durability of electrochemical cells showing <30 percent loss of capacity after 7000 cycles.\n",
